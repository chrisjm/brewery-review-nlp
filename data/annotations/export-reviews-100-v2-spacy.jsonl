Capones prices are competitive with some of the smaller local area liquor stores and they have a parking lot (which is rare) to boot. They have the best selection of local microbrews/craft beer in the city and promote as much locally as possible (don't know how many of the actual brewers I have run into that shop here and drop off their beers by hand)."}

He brought us here because he loves the french fries (an alehouse is always a good choice for me). A good mid-afternoon lunch crowd. Looked like an old-school tavern. Lots of brick, large chalkboard beer menu, large glass windows out front, and pub-style seats and table. Service was decent enough; no complaints. Selection was good. I like how they have their beer menu set up. They decide to feature one beer of each style, so the list IPA, Stout, Pilsener, Porter, and then what brewery made it. So there is one of every major style on tap. I actually went with the specialty beer of the moment, which was the Anacortes Dubbel. This place is also known for its sandwiches ($10.75) which dominate the menu, and we all enjoyed a lot. This is a cool place to visit for a beer and some food, but certain people may get a bit bored with the slightly streamlined beer menu."}

The beers that they brew on the premises are not all that great, but they do have \"visiting\" beers that should fill the void. I had a salad and sandwich and I wasn't disappointed.

They did a nice job on the building giving it a clean, modern look with wooden long tables inside and picnic tables outside. Long bar with about 8 seats and left open on both ends for people to walk up and order beer without crawling over the people sitting at the bar. I like nice touches like this. Plenty of people working behind the bar so there is never a wait for help. A lot of options for beer, if you like saisons, wild/sour beer. I had two beers and the kombucha. They looked different but all tasted identical. The house fermentation seems to dominate the other flavors. It tasted good but I hope for some different flavors to come out once they get more established."}

It's worth noting that I am a very young and scrawny looking 21 year old who is often met with rudeness upon ordering drinks from a bar or even restaurant, but not here. At Comrade the gentlemen bar master was very friendly and approachable. He was merrily drinking an Imperial Stout. I would highly recommend."}
