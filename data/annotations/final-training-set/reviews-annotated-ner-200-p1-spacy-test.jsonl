Yet, no one makes both. This place makes neither. Plus, I'm sick of places that win no recent awards touting awards from 10 years ago. That brewer probably isn't still there.

Lots of guys drunkenly hitting on girls, and a few jock casualties actually walking around staring down admiringly at their intentionally puffed out chests. Wow. My one visit will not be repeated.

Farmer's platter is very tasty and the bison burger is pretty tasty, too. Food was a little pricey and the pints were about 50 cents more than I'd like. It's worth a stop especially since they have so much to go beer available."}
