The food is very good as well. The atmosphere can be great and some places even have live music. Sounds perfect right? Well..not so fast. My biggest gripe with this chain has always been service. I use to work across the street from the one in downtown Richmond. Clients wanted to go to lunch there. We could never get in and out in under 90 minutes and it was usually a lot closer to 2 hours. Service at night wasn't much better. The bar can be extremely crowded and the beertenders can get overwhelmed. Most are very knowledgeable. They have a 1/2 price growler night. Well worth trying but bring your patience when you go."}

Unfortunately they were missing something like 4-6 of their drafts. Kind of a bummer, but warrants a trip back for sure. The thing that bothered me was the building. One of the roman arches of the atrium was held together with plywood and screws... The two side porticos of this beautiful old building were hacked up- door knobs ripped right out and liquid nails'd shut. Hopefully these are temporary fixes."}

The only bad part of our experience was our waitress. She was very slow to bring us our drinks. The place wasn't that crowded. I had asked for a second beer when I was halfway thru my dinner. She came back when we were both finished and ask if she could get us anything else. I asked for my other beer. She had completely forgotten about it. My husband came here on another night and thinks he had the same waitress because he had the same issue with his waitress. I would go back."}
