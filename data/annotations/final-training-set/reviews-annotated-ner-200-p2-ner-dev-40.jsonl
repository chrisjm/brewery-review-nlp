The brick oven pizza is good -- I have never strayed from the one with anchovies and capers, but am told that the others are good, too. The menu is not too diverse, but that is not why I like this place. I like it because the beer menu is really a \"book\" that is very thick, very diverse and logically organized. If you know what you are in the mood for, you can find it quickly. If you are inclined to browse, the beer menu offers tasting notes to steer you in one direction or another. In addition to the large number of bottles (this is the place I first encountered Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA), they rotate draft beer selections and whoever is picking the kegs and casks knows what he or she is doing. Beer flights are also available, which is a good way to sample the wares before settling into a pint."}
