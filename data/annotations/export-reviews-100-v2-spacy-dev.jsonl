They usually have 5 or so beers on tap at Trinity and sometimes they also have a cask beer. The selection is mostly standard beers but occasionally they throw out some beers from off the beaten path. Their IPA is a decent version of this classic beer(I personally prefer a more west coast hopped version). The food selection is what you would expect to find at most brew pubs . I have had the mussels, nachos, and a pulled pork sandwich and all of which I enjoyed. My favorite beers at trinity are the Russian Imperial Stout, the White Electric Coffee Stout, and the Ripta. Great place to check out before and or after events at the Dunkin Donut center since they are so close."}

It doesn't look far from the Inner Harbor on a map, but after walking around Baltimore all day, any way to cut out walking was a bonus.

A quick ID check at the door soon led me to a haven of different beer."}
