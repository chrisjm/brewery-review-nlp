I stayed in here for about an hour and just couldnt stop stacking up on beers.
and I attended one of Alex's all-grain Demos.
Picnic tables, big screen TV's, special events, and the beer is good too.
Look out for their "biggest" little beer fest and tap take overs.
the SS reviews here are clear and to the point.
Stopped in here on my way home just to see how many of these I could hit really.
ill be back on a different night next time...

Lines from James Joyce, Yeats and other classic Emerald Island authors plaster the walls, along with soccer (oops,
Penny Lane is a convivial British pub situated on a corner in downtown Richmond, and a few convenient blocks from the Capital Ale House
Straight-up sensual New Orleans flair, complete with earth-toned walls and floors, mardi-gras beads on the taps, and candle-lit tables and bathrooms.
Always good to know where these stores are as you can always find something.
A HUGE plus of the Argus is they are dog friendly on the patio!
However, it has the hopping vibe that a bar has, very fun.
However it's nice to see a decent mixed use space.
When my first selection was unavailable there were plenty of other beers to try instead.
The only other bar in Columbus with a competitive draft selection is Bob's Bar.
the pale was disappointing, the ipa good, and i very much liked the imperial ipa.
A wide representation of Texas brews are draft and
The craft beer selection was fantastic and there were lots of thigns on the shelf from Revolution,
They do a lot of tap takeovers with some really unique and limited stuff.
This new bar is a standout in a location (Hell's Kitchen) that could use a few more options like it.
i had literally never heard of this place, in planning or anything, until i drove past this week.
This place is located near the Octoberfest grounds, but is sort of out of the way.
It gets kind of loud in there, but other than that no real issues.
It is quite difficult to find a bar with this selection in the area.
Really cool semi-industrial but classy taproom with a good beer selection of a lot of various styles.
It felt kind of like we were visiting a fraternity or club house of some sort.
The place is located in an older section of the downtown area in a storefront setting.
The pizza is creative and excellent, with fresh local ingredients.
Dotty Dumplings used to be off State St. near the Capitol.
It's a little bit away from the very touristy center of town, and thus a bit more relaxing.
That being said, however, their draft beer selection is above average when compared with the normal sports bar.
Only stayed for one beer because I was bored.
Good selection of seasonals and year round beers.
From the outside it looks unexpecting, the sign is dark and rusted.
Good selection with a mix of locals, rergionals, some harder to find stuff, and a pretty sizable European lineup.
I recommend the house pizza, which had a crazy amount of toppings on it.
The brewery trying to upset the norm in one of the holiest beer drinking lands on Earth.
I have since consistently been going back.
The place did have a nice atmosphere, with a large open door allowing fresh air to come in.
Beer section has shrunk in the past couple years, although they just added a decent make your own 6-pack section.
The place is definitely a dive but does have a full menu including decent entrees.
I think the highlight of this place is the food though.
Me, running the streets of vegas, howling, deranged, nose in the air, fresh beer, it's close, real close, I can smell it...
They have a very good and diverse selection.
The ultimate mess salad (topped with pulled pork and cole slaw was excellent (according to my wife) and the smoked wings were also very tasty (according to my taste buds).
It's centrally located near Flying Saucer, Crank Arm, and some other great spots but this has now moved to the top of our list.
I have some stores nearby but not in the same city.
The place is packed, as is expected to be during the biggest sporting event in the world.
I didn't order any food but what I saw looked decent.
Some music playing in the background, but it is loud in here from all the people talking.
This a truly great local brewery in Cincinnati.
Food selection was limited to snacks, we didn't have any.
Prices a lot more reasonable than what I'm used to in NY.
The selection did not include an IPA that disappointed me and my beer loving friends.
The guy working there was very helpful, and friendly with my kids.
but there was an hour or so wait for tables (based on being at the bar near the host stand).
It is located at the Sorbonne end of Rue de la Harpe, very handy for the metro (Cluny - La Sorbonne).
I have been here on numerous occasions and have always had a great experience.
if it was closer to my house... or work, it is closer to work than home, but I do make that effort to stop in...
The beer is set off in one section of the store, and extends alll tthhheee wayyy doowwnn.
2 blocks from the Bell Centre makes this a perfect place to grab a beer before or after an event.
A clean store with more open space than the average liquor store, which was nice.
I've been to Ormsby's a couple times, most recently in Feb '11.
The bartender did not seem to friendly spent most of his time talking to what seemed to be regulars.
Plenty of flat screen tv's in your field of vision no matter where you sit in the bar.
Warm atmosphere, nice long bar downstairs.
Frequently serving a cask selection as well.
if you're already in Hamden it's better to drive down the road to MiKro.
The service was very good, our waitress was attentive and helpful in both beer and food selection.
They had so many more at the Funkatorium.
Outdoor area will be great once weather improves.
Upon searching the coolers of brew available to take home, it became evident that these guys only sell bombers of beer.
It’s guarded by no less than three men on scooters, we don’t acknowledge them, and enter…
Great small (very small) brewery tucked in the alley off Tennyson St. Complex
Decent tap selection of maybe 12 with a focus on VT brews.
but I would hardly call this any sort of beer destination.
We've been there a couple times before and really enjoyed it.
For a while, they were putting IPAs on the hot shelf, but not no mo.
I suggest brunch on Sunday with two imperial pints of wheat or bitter.
Both front of house and a large back room where concerts are held, and large outside grounds open to accommodate the crowd.
The atmosphere is very low key where you can meet with friends for a coversation, food and most important good beer.
It was a very nice bitter though nothing amazing.
Boy am I glad I did; this place is a little known gem.
The highlight of this trip was Ringwood XXXX Porter Winter Ale.
and I was in the area at lunchtime, so I thought I'd check it out.
It is delicious, spicy and comes in a bread bowl.
They offer a veggie burger which is average, but, at least, they have one.
They also have a refrigerator that is usually stocked with about 10 of their beers, for sale to go.
In addition, they have a selection of about 20 beers on tap and many more in bottles.
One of the beers has been showing in stock at this store location for 2 weeks
I'd been to a couple of BJ's in the northwest and wasn't in a rush to get back
It took me 10 minutes to get a pint of their red ale, which was outstanding.
Wide open floor plan allows for easy movement from one end of the building to the other.
C'mon guys put a half decent meal in front of me and I won't complaint.
Definitely a place to pop in and have a beer during your Asheville pub crawl, andd a place to take in a movie if you've got more time.
Happy hour here is just as expensive as ithe regular menu elsewhere
It's really cool to see so many people embracing and enjoying craft beer.
This was another stop of mine when we hit Berlin a few days ago, and it was indeed the most enjoyable of the beer-related stops we managed to make.
And whatever you say he has something "Bettah."
Since it took a while to get our check, I ended up ordering a second beer, the Cantillion Iris Grand Cru on tap, which was much more mellow than the regular version.
I stop into Moose's Tooth everytime that I stop into Anchorage.
Im a serious history buff, so I was very excited about the entire project.
As such, we opted for Southern Sun, which is like Mountain Sun Lite, or so they say, and on the way back to Denver kind of...
It's no competition for Bodega, but if you have to find a place to keep your mainstream-clinging friends happy, this is a no-brainer.
From what I’ve seen of this area, there’s the local Dogfish Ale House in Fairfax
Cool old brick building with two bars, games, friendly service and really good beer.
He indicated to me what when I was ready to place the order just feel free to do so.
had I chosen from the vast selection of standard macros.
Liquor as far as the eye can see, with one aisle for six packs of beer, and one of bombers.
The back patio blends you in with the neighborhood perfectly.
and then, I'll stick with Village Draft House, especially when they expand and have 99 beers on tap.
Has good beer selection but not what I would call a beer place.
At A&M, we do our best to meet the needs of our Homebrewers.
DRIVE SLOW because the potholes will crush your car.
The space inside was very modern looking, but they have 5 tables outside in front, which were available so that's where we sat.
There were crafts from various parts of the country, as well as a lot of locals.
I am looking forward to getting my mug at 125 beers.
Waitresses knew what beers they had and a little about them.
While none of the staff seem to be craft beer experts they have certainly tried most of the beers on draft and can tell you what they think.
Nice selection of regional and local beers, reasonable prices.
(All beer should be amazingly fresh, as Southern Grist’s new production facility operates in a separate building directly behind this west Nashville location.)
It's always fun sampling beers where they are brewed
I visited with five other people at 6:45 on a Wednesday (we had reservations).
The service was good in spite of all the people.
If you're seeking the world's strangest beer bars, this is a must-see.
The bar is very big, and seems to have barley in the bar top for a neat look, but overall there is not a comfortable feeling here.
One wall of the building is all glass and absorbs a great deal of heat on a sunny day to the point that their A/C system could not keep on the day I visited.
Relaxing stop around the corner from the Mint.
Easiest the best beer offering I have ever come across.
went quite a while back before I even drank beer, had heard they had good pizza...
I've also have been to his other location the mowhak bend.
We visited in the early afternoon 8 September, 2006.
Luckily TX has great breweries to offer; Deep Ellum, Thirsty Planet, 512...they all have great stuff
It's true - most of the warehouse-style liquor store is dedicated to spirits and wines.
It is a great spot, right under an old campus building.
I went to this brewery and restaurant for lunch today with my family.
Best customer experience in the market place!
Yes it is for imperial pints and it does include the 10% gst.
Prices were very reasonable for what we got .
Anything I have had from these folks has been top notch for sure.
I noticed a few seasonals including some bigger beers like the Double IPA, a barleywine and an imperial stout.
The atmosphere is typical of the Pearl District, a bit on the trendy side, but the roof deck is great in the summer.
and we only had to wait a little bit for a table.
Selection is good with changes of seasonals and others.
It feels welcoming in the summer, but maybe
I really love brewpubs and thought this place was laid out very well.
That said I would not describe this as a beer bar.
Inside is a rather standard looking retail space with open white, metal rafters with hanging fluorescent lights.
I've only used their online website and haven't been to the actual store....yet.
Fortunately, Scottish Arms is here to save the day.
The service was helpful and pleasant in late afternoon on a holiday weekend.
Upstairs is great, but if downstairs is open, definitely head down!
for now its some tables and chairs and a tiny bar with only a few seats, but its all about the beer in here, definitely some of the best i have had around the midwest.
nothing seems hurried or mass produced...
The vibe is very relaxed and I like it that way.
What a nice, laid back place to have a brew and good food.
Really good selection of brews from the US, and a fair selection from Canada and abroad.
Most beers are ok, with at least one on tap
Their events are pretty regular and include things like yoga and brunch.
The taproom is in the corner of their brewing facility.
The food always kicks ass, and the beer selection is surprising, especially considering the smallness of the place.
I loved this place, but sadly it's out of business and permanently closed.
Walking into the bakery, you're greeted by the delicious smell of fresh baked bread and pastries.
Don't go for the food b/c its not very good.
Awesome outdoor patio at the converted auto shop compliments the excellent food options to enjoy while drinking any of the several great tasting options brewed in premises.
I got a bottle of Hoppin Frog Hop Dam to go for like 14 bucks, I guess that's comparable to bottle shop pricing.
They have a sign that says they have 3000 beers for sale in the front window.
it has it all going on, a huge patio out front
Took maltos review and went up to Yaletown about 3 months ago.
Dark wood and comfortable seating provide an inviting atmosphere.
Decent enough selection without many surprises.
Loads of barrels help set the atmosphere for what you'll be drinking.
It took us several times to get out beers and when we decided to eat at the Pub it took a long time to order our food, get our food or be able to get to any waiter.
I wish I would have waited to eat here instead of eating at Torched Hop.
Had plenty of good local beers during the night, as well as a Chouffe (whoops).
I can assure you I will hit here next time in San Diego and it might be my only stop, but it will be during the day!
you don't get a choice of any single beer in the store to put it (they stock it with a random 30-40 beer singles of diff breweries/style) but hey, it's still pretty good..
this place would have probably gotten a two star from me instead of three.
Decent variety here of local and national brands.
Great selection, especially for the neighborhood, where mostly you will find Bodegas selling BMC and the odd Brooklyn, DFH, Leffe variety of craft beer.
I always ask for a recommendation on a new beer.
A single slice is $5.75, a medium pie is $16.50, and a full 16"er is $20.50.
Ironic considering the owner, Curt Decker, trash talked our beers at 2nd Story after the official closure of his first brewing endeavor, Nodding Head.
These guys are awesome, my girlfriend and I absolutely love this place.
This is a bit of an odd place, tucked away in the basement of what seemed to be an office building.
Very long bar with lots and lots of taps displayed...
The beer wasn't overpriced at all (maybe by $1) compared to local distributors, which was comforting because we were buying it from a restaurant.
If you're looking to get away from other tourists, consider Beer Planet.
I'm going to give these guys praise that seems to be missing on here compared to other places.
(It happened to be Tallgrass 8 Bit and Arrogant Bastard by Stone ... nice!)
A bit out of the way but definitely worth it.
I didn't have a burger (heard they are good)
I would recommend this place to any craft beer enthusiast.
The two side porticos of this beautiful old building were hacked up-
I have no complaints here and hope to visit more MM's in the future!
My wife and I stopped by for dinner this past Friday and were very impressed with this new addition to the ever growing Philly beer scene.
I would highly recommend their guided tour as I learned a lot about lambic production, though they also offer a self guided version as well.
I probably am the wrong person to review a chain Grill and Bar, but I'll try to be merciful...
I've been here a half dozen times and the beer selection is above average, the burgers are great, but the beers are a tad on the pricey side.
Surrounded by trees, the pub is nice and clean and fresh looking.
Ordered up some sandwiches, and mine was damn good.
The place is much smaller on the inside than I expected.
Worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood or want to wet your whistle while riding on the trail.
Verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry Scarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrey.
Never gets cramped and is of high quality.
I've eaten here a total of three times and the food has always been good bordering on excellent.
Low service score is for the blatant price gouging.
Once you walk in, theres the bar and a few tables, then more tables in the back area.
I'd be curious to try some of their specialty pizzas.
Overall, if you can handle being talk down too and like felling awkward when asking for advice on your next batch this is the place for you.
Wouldn't go out of my way to return here, but might stop by if in the neighbourhood.
If I'm in the area, I think I would stop for the atmosphere alone...
Obviously I don't need to describe much more than that to explain what makes this place so fantastic.
very army and regimented, clever and witty yes, but also unrelaxing and puzzling.
While you wait that hour for your table you can stand near the well stocked bar.
Had a sampler and all of the beer were very good to excellent.
I was glad that i could make, wish I could come for one of their events
It's what a brewery should do; get better.
Bottles everywhere - trust me - you'll find something you're looking for.
Walk right down here to the end, honest!!
I would like to check out their happy hour however, as I hear it's really inexpensive.
It's pretty calm but get get loud on game nights and weekends.
Oldsmar Beer place sells all the same beers for $1.98-$2.89 a bottle, NOT $10, and they will rush-order just about anything you want.
No way in spite of the fact that they have good beer that this place is in business in two years.
They have an outstanding bottle selection and really great service.
The place has the feel of a fairly good sized restaurant/bar, with a couple of flat screen TV's over the bar (turned to golf and the O's game).
Walnut Liquorette for the past couple years and have been consistently impressed by the quality and selection.
In the Summer you can drink outside on the Pavement and watch the world go by.
That being said, I always try to stop in at non-peak hours.
Since it is in PA, the prices are expensive when compared to beer stores in neighboring states.
The beer selection is pretty good, they have 15 taps which are always rotating, and two regulars, Guinness and Miller Lite.
It's nice that they encourage an adventuresome spirit in trying out new stuff.
Excellent service but understand the menu will be entirely in French.
Right at the waterfront and close to downtown hotels, RiRa is a great place to have a sandwich and a few pints
Clifford the Big Red Ale is excellent but we have the American hangup here of serving a higher ABV in a small $5, 10oz glass.
Beer makes up the left hand wall of the store.
Service was great, the crowd was fun, but it definitely is not a beer geek only place.
While I'm in Copenhagen, I'd like to try as many of the bars as are listed in Beerfly.
It is some what pricey and very touristy.
its not necessarily a destination place like church key or black squirrel
Sunday nights are the best with an irish music session featuring local artists.
Service is like most of any distributors but if you ever have a special order I'm sure this place will work with you...
Stopped in for a snack on a rainy afternoon last week.
We stopped here to have lunch and to try their beers.
Bartenders are generally knowledgeable about the beer and food.
Comes off as a trendy Mexican restaurant.
I think I walked out with a case of random beers!
The beer selection is outstanding with 30 different beers on tap.
All below average compared to the others in the area.
A few of the beers were described as bold in hop flavor yet lacked.
You meet the nicest people standing in line for their can releases.
It's Great place to socialize and hangout on a Friday or Saturday night...
I saw 4 or 5 that I really wanted, but I was short on time, so I could only have one.
Courteous service provided me with a bottle list.
The owner lied to me about certain bottles that didn't have dates and said they came in on the truck "yesterday".
Had cans available for purchase retail as well as swag including shirts/glassware.
The staff was on point with my questions, knew what they were talking about.
One of the bevy of breweries in the Ballard area.
I understand they have tasting events and the like on certain evenings
I have to start with the food, because this is the real disaster for me.
Completely separate line need the bar to order drinks.
im a patient guy, i know what its like to be on the other side, but they had three bartenders not look up for about 20 minutes, no joke
The Po Boy a bit light on the shrimp maybe two to three large fried shrimp on a half loaf of Mancini's bread.
Bayview is a great beer neighborhood, with Roman's, Sugar Maple, and Palm Tavern nearby on Kinnickinic.
Cement floors and wooden benches pretty much make up the decor of this place.
Beer aside the food is awesome and really elevates them as a beer bar; good beer and good food go hand in hand!
That said, I don't quite think it's worth a 45 minute wait or more to get a beer and a meal.
mainly because it is open all hours of the (weekend) night, and convenient for hungover drinking and munching.
I honestly hadn't heard of this place before.
Big open taproom with ample seating, high ceilings, brewery/tanks just behind bar.
This is definitely the better of the two Ale Houses in Raleigh.
8 hand pumps and 6 taps let you know what is going down.
I had speckled hen and PranOster Golden Ale from North Coast Brewing.
They had a short selection (maybe 7 or 8 on draft), 4 of which were pale ales or IPAs----so a decent variety.
$6-$7 per beer, but the two rare Floyds were ten bucks.
Just recently had their take on an Imperial Oktoberfest.
Stopped by here for a few beers and to check this somewhat new place out.
Stopped in here for the first time tonight.
Very large, there are about 50 booths around the perimeter and about 50 more tables surrounding the very large bar.
Did not have any of the food selection since we were fed after judging.
Have had 3 really good meals there, with good service.
Everyone who works here is friendly and knowledgeable.
I recommend starting out with a flight and move on from there.
I also have found it always to be very busy.
With tip we're looking at over $10 for a tiny beer.
A lot of beer, but it pared well with their exceptional Hanford Flat-iron steak (mashed potatoes and grilled green beans with a wine sauce reduction).
They were quite friendly, but the manager might want to get another host(ess)
Another catch-up rating from my DC trips.
Wife and I just shared a bao order, which was good.
Easy access from the downtown Berkeley BART station.
Even when they know a consumer will pay the premium for a case, they don't bump the price.
But the true draw is the incredible beer list.
If you're in the Five Boroughs you absolutely must make a stop into this bar.
service was so friendly and honest, again unpretentious, and very kind and knowledgeable about the beers.
They have 22 taps buy only 6 are currently used.
All their local stuff was chilled, which was annoying
"Fucking terrible, that's why I'm telling you about it".
Class brewery and one of the best in the state for my tastes.
The head brewer, Ken, is super passionate about beer and the brewing process and it really shows!
Interior is a cool little space with interesting art- they had giant Lego art with the likes of the Duck Hunt logo, etc.
The beer list was fine, though not extensive.
Everything sees to be over priced just a bit on tap, and the prices for growlers are just the price for 4 pints, rather than discounted just a bit like
In exactly the opposite order as recommended in a prior review below, I came here via recommendation from a local chef for the sandwiches, and stayed for the beer.
Except for a few beers displayed near the checkout stands, the beer is located at the back of the store in a large walk in cooler, quite a large volume and variety.
Store seems to be very dedicated to wine and liquor.
I had the escargot for an appetizer, and Erica has some fried Maredsous abbaye cheese.
They're brewing up a few experimental batches of chickow right now, or so I hear, so if you're in Cincinnati get there!
One of my favorite places to go out for beer in the city.
Their wings were fantastic and the waitstaff was great!
They both tasted buttery with a light smoke which kinda hints at a possible line infection.
Think of a haunted house that serves beer.
The head brewer was inexperienced and has since left.
They were pouring six beers when I was there.
Upon entering, you get a nice view of the bar, which even before they started seating for dinner was already packed and for good reason.
but what bar isn't in the Tobacco Capital of America?
Blonde Ale, DIPA, Brown Stout, Smoked IPA, Farmhouse, bourbon IPA
Had a couple of pints of their IPA and was impressed.
Smith and Lentz should be considered a must-go for any beer fan in Nashville.
Small brewery, set a bit back from the street in an industrial area of Torrance.
Great store for beer, best location on Brodie ln for buying beer (best prices too).
Service is usually good although the busier they are the service starts to suffer.
The IPA wasn't the greatest, but it was acceptable.
There was no visible bottle list when Iwas there and the draft list was mediocre.
Customer service has always been great, and it's very reasonable to get some samples of what's on tap before deciding to fill your growler.
Getting cooler now and a 45 Fathoms Porter is a welcome find.
An easy landmark on the path from Fell's Point to Canton at the intersection of Boston and Fleet Sts.
Bartender was great and friendly, helped out whenever possible even when the bar filled up.
Also not many larger 750ml bottles to choose from.
Service is helpful and spoke English with me (two different servers over the course of my one hour visit).
When compared to Night Shift (just 100 meters away), this place is shockingly different.
Probably the largest selection of craft beer I’ve ever seen in a liquor store.
One note: if you sit on the patio there is no table service, you have to go to the bar to get your beer.
Peanut Butter Milk Stout called Gunner's Daughter which is fantastic.
you can barely call it a bar, but they use the space well, managing to squeeze in some tables, and even a small stage for bands, apparently.
The bartender knew a lot about the beer he was serving.
Hard for me to rate this as a beer bar only in that I went on a Saturday afternoon at 1PM and there were four people in the place, so
Have one big cooler, and a long row of room temp brews.
Ever beer on the menu except one has been around since I started drinking craft... and that one was sold out...
The location is a little dicey - a stink, presumably from the river, permeated the air outside but did not follow us in.
Servers were amazing, knew a lot about the beer, including glassware and history.
The bar has room for about a dozen people.
I tried a few ipas and they were no match for alpine or ballast point.
Found the entire staff to be extremely friendly, especially notable considering the huge crowds they bring in for the festival.
Had Avery, Victory, Ommegang, Founders, Lagunitas, to namea few.
They have a very good selection of imports in the right cooler, anything you could possibly want.
Must be a popular place for business lunches.
Tour was fun and really gave a great sense of the brewery.
It's nearly all beer and the exceptions were some ciders and there may have been meads.
My only complaint is that there is smoking allowed in the bar area, which is connected to the other half of the restaurant without much separation.
Bilbo's has been growing on me, because I quit going for food, just beer.
and I'm sure this atmosphere appeals to many.
although a little small, we went late afternoon so it wasn't very busy.
Sometimes the beer is great and sometimes its mediocre (I guess like any typical Brew Pub).
A huge selection of beer, as well as food, make Der Braumeister
but hey, it would've been nice to have gotten into the craft beer scene a lot earlier in life.
We hit Salute, a NC wine festival in Winston Salem, NC, and Small Batch had a booth at the event.
There are tables set aside for casual dining and some tables around the bar as well.
A vast selection to choose from and selection changes regularly.
A lot of options for all your brewing needs.
The selection of beers is usually pretty good- 5-8 beers on tap at any given time, with some standards always on draft.
I had not heard of a lot of the beers on the list.
In the back of the store there are several glass front refridgerators that contain a decent beer selection.
They do have several promotions mixd in which is cool, but again geared toward the college crowd.
Was just at Binny's Lincoln Park picking up my Sam Adams Utopias and can't help but feel like a kid ina candy store when I come here.
A: It is a hole in the wall bar, but it has interesting decorations from old Ellicott city and cool beer signs.
Went with a group of 5 each ordered 3 rounds of drinks and each round
The bar is nice, but the dining room is large and loud(perhaps it was the table of 10 ladies next to us).
Looks like they have lots of cool hop plants when it's not covered in snow.
Having said that, I'm willing to give them a third chance.
they even had hopfen-weisse, which was infinitely better than it was when i first had it in the states.
The location is nice but the selection of beers is not as great as the one on colonial.
I've been going here for years and used to love it.
I am now even more excited than before to live where I am.
Phil’s doing one night having escaped Mug’s intact to come here, wherever here is.
Had my inaugural experience at Sheffield's over the weekend.
There IS no vibe - 'Industrial Way' pretty much says it all.
I overheard that they were short 2 waitresses the night we were there.
You get great BBQ from a gas station after all.
I have no complaints whatsoever about this store.
We didn't go to the funkatorium because we had the fur babies.
A must go if staying in downtown or south Austin.
Whatever your opinion of their beer, the Tap Room at the MacTarnahan's/Portland brewery is a worthwhile destination.
The selection is nearly as good, if not better, than the famed Brickstore in Decatur, GA.
although, there wasn't much in the way of hard to find beers on tap.
This place has a huge L shaped bar with a grey stone top and can easily seat about 20 or more patrons.
Open warehouse style with a direct view of the mash tuns opened in 2014.
I find it worth while to shop online for brewing equipment/ingredients, especially since there are no other options in SD.
I think Frank at Bell Beverage is just great people, he likes to discuss beer, and is very knowledgeable when it comes to suggestions for new beers.
The pizza is quite good if you like oven fired thin crust, which I do.
Honestly, I would not include this place in a review of beer bars.
I could skip the other two, but any trip to Montréal for me requires a visit.
They had $5 fish and chips on Saturdays which is always a bargain if you ask me.
I always find the rarest beers in this place.
Thin crust, not huge, but enough to share.
The value was about average, and overall, I’ll definitely be hitting this place again whenever I visit Madison again.
They were nothing special at all, however the Pale Ale was tasty.
He said their beer buyer is trying to increase the selection of beer and it shows.
so I wanted to hit up the local shops there to grab some stuff to bring back to the East Coast.
Friend and I both had 3 beers each and food.
One cannot make the claim that one is a self-professed Beer Geek/Beer Nerd without having visited the Foodery.
The beers are pretty much what you would expect from a traditional British pub in the US.
Cool decor with tractor seats used as stools.
The staff are friendly; helpful; and have pretty good knowledge of the beer.
You need not worry about mainstream music while you are enjoying your beer.
The basic tour is free, however you can pay and have a VIP Smokestack Tour which we heard was outstanding.
We sat outside at one of the tables and ordered a few beers.
Very nicely restorded inside, especially the high ceilings and the aging barrels.
The servers weren't insanely friendly, but they do their jobs and don't ignore you.
(UPDATING MY PREVIOUS REVIEW, just to help clarify for posters as of late 2009/early 2010:
They provide four 8 oz samples AND they have a beer stop half way through the tour.
Great beer selection with a lot of local stuff that I was eager to try.
There really is just about anything you could imagine to entertain while you quaff some great brews.
Waldo's has been an establishment on WMU's campus for over 20 years and has become the token weekend hangout for us.
but i can see where it can get very crowded on the weekends.
really solid beers but not such exciting styles
2 stories high and plenty of tables to sit with your friends trying to act Irish.
All they have are the stereotypical Guinness, Harp, Carleberg, Bass Pale Ale and one or tow other non-attention grabbing tap offerings.
My only warning - Happy Hour applies only If you are sitting/standing in the bar area.
Individualized mugs for J.P.'s mug club hang over the bar.
12 Bones is located in a low slung cement block building in the Arts District, around the block from Wedge Brewing.
I had an Odell Friek and an AleSmith .394.
love the length of the bar and the quality of the booths, the pool tables, and if you dig on butter, the free popcorn could be a plus.
The beers I had though were of course all excellent, and the staff was very generous, excited, knowledgable, and apparently genuinely happy.
It's close to the Hendrik Conscience Plein, Moriaanstraat runs east-west south of Wolstraat (along which the eastbound trams run to Deurne).
Also, the tasting room does not have A/C, only fans.
Werewolves is a nice porter free of any added flavorings, they have several good hoppy beers, and I also liked their Sound & Vision Cranberry Sour.
It looked like just the laid-back neighborhood joint that would deliver, due to the taps and menu posted online.
The pizzas are of the craft style not fast food style.
met by Saveon, on my side of our good sized little town.
Thinking Man Tavern is located on the "outskirts" of Decatur, heading towards Candler Park & Lil 5 Points on W. Howard Ave.
I love a beer bar that has Ranier on tap, and they do!
I quickly pulled the cord and jumped off of the bus as soon as the doors opened.
Nothing dark and two nearly identical beers.
Grabbed a bite to eat first, sitting right next to the door that separates the brewery from the restaurant.
NE IPA that resembled nothing of the sort.
Stop number 3 on a Kolsch bar-hop through the center of Cologne.
found some Cheeryfunk bishop’s barrel ,lovechild#4 and much more limited release Definitely recommended.
I was hungry and the food was good enough.
They have a good selection of Oregon beer, a little Washington, California and other states, and small international.
Went here for a tasting and was a little surprised to say the least.
I was first introduced to this place by a friend of mine who used this site to find a new place to buy beer.
Stopped in here with Deuane, thain709, and StormKing47 on our trip around DE and MD last week.
I am never disappointed with the food at this place.
Love the way the menu is setup, listing draught beers by type and bottled beers by country.
Being from the easy coast originally...I am still trying to find my go to place in New Orleans.
Well, we were starving BUT wanted to try the food here.
The place has a very good selection of beers, the atmosphere is very lively and the food is decent.
non students, frat guys, hipsters, CCM musicians, the whole gamut.
They had 5 different brews to choose from and only 3 were available.
I just wish it was closer to where I live.
but I had a big thirst already worked up, which is good.
They have an overwhelming selection of liquor and REALLY nice wines.
Picked up a 4 pack of Pseudosue (not refrigerated) which involved purchasing a 4 pack of Golden Nugget dated from August.
The guys sent an email to me saying I should stop by and see what they had.
We came here on our drive back home, before hitting Bell’s Brewery in Kalamazoo.
Smaller shops tweet and advertise on facebook when they get these things in stock (KBS, Hopslam...)
This place was right next to our hotel, so it was the last stop before crashing.
And the Comeback Inn (which you can go to from the side door in the Essen Haus) has still more options.
Stopped in after shopping next door at Whole Foods.
Overall great place to buy your beer and liquor.
A good deck, very friendly service, and trendy restaurant.
If you are a fan of half assed imports like Smithwicks, Guinness, Bass, Heineken, Harp, etc.
The bar is pretty large and wraps around.
The patio has a beautiful view overlooking the river/pond, but it was raining on my visit
New arrivals get posted to their facebook page regularly.
They have a great selection of local CA breweries (Stone, Coronado, Bootlegger's) and a good selection of European beers.
Visited after checking out the Xmas lights downtown.
Stop number 5 on my Beer Trail of Bamberg, Germany.
I definitely recommend you get in, the perks are amazing!
its about a half hour drive south of kansas city proper, but well worth the trek.
a good mix of innovation and classic styles in here, all quite well executed.
I used to live down the street, but moved away before I realized what a treasure I had just a block away.
The wives had their mimosas and seemed quite pleased.
This is a real, honest, salt-of-the-earth workmen's pub.
Neat setting in a suburban industrial park.
What is more relaxing than strolling around the French Quarter with a beer from Sidney's?
Part of Calgary's Best Pubs chain which includes Kilkenny in Brentwood, Shanechie (?spelling), and one other that escapes me.
I found myself at this Taco Mac with my kids only because the Brick Store was inexplicably closed for lunch.
Still no issue finding something to drink.
Oh ya there is no food but a bunch of menus and Beth's Cafe is down the road to satisfy your stomach.
Tasty and authentic German food at reasonable prices.
It's definitely worth visiting when in Cincinnati.
This is my place when i am looking for something that the big guys dont have.
This restaurant has only been open a couple months, and other than the city and the specific building's characteristics
We were supposed to eat in the loft of the barn
There is a children's play area in a far corner, plus we could see an outdoor patio at the rear of the building.
Add to that an excellent tap system from Europe[Vervenne & Van Belle]
On one hand, a rating of 3.35 is absolutely ridiculous.
First off I have to say I was there two years ago, but it was such a good experience that I ended up remembering the experience very well.
Upon arriving we put our name in to get a table and were told it was about an hour wait.
The worst part about moving out of Windsor Terrace, aside from lack of access to Prospect Park, was leaving behind the Double Windsor.
I went here because they have several TV's
The beer menu was as long as other locations and had a nice mix of varieties and countries of origin, and a good number of Yard House brand beers.
They have something for everyone - tons of appetizers, probably 8-10 salad options, pizzas, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, etc.
The beers are pretty solid, nothing spectacular.
Nonetheless, the place does have some redeeming qualities.
and I'll never stop recommending ya'll to anybody.
The Tap also features art from local artists on its walls.
This is a somewhat trendy new place that has opened next to the Hotel Commonwealth on Comm Ave in Kenmore Sq.
I am pretty sure this place wasn't around 10 years ago when I lived here.
Parking is typically scarce in the surrounding area.
, I think bigger isn't always necessarily better.
Plus, you can take your girlfriend here for a nice dinner and still get to enjoy some tasty brews.
The look of the establishment can only be described as classy...
Cool buildings and layout, amazing beers for onsite consumption as well as take away (they can vary on options very widely).
Seems like what a traditional German place would be like, atleast from what I've read and heard about.
The employee told me I would have to ask a manager (with no offer to do that for me).
The service was exceptional and the tacos were amazing!
As a start to the night at every new brewery I go to I get the sampler.
Here's the good news, De Kelk is a great spot east of the city center to grab a beer without the crowds of tourists.
, I think it was more that there was lots of up, and then a little down to lure you into the false sense of,
Probably the best in the area, especially for sours.
I imagine the atmosphere might be a little more compelling at a different time.
Worth checking out if you're in the area (especially w/
Space is well appointed feeling cozy despite its sprawling size and nature.
Foodwise, it's pricier than an average diner, but nothing exorbitant.
It's in a fairly large, old building with several other businesses.
We sat by the windows looking into Fore Street- good people watching!
All of these brews are found at most every restaurant.
In addition to the seating at the bar, there is another bar area with both private tables and communal seating.
I have visited several times and will continue to return.
A lot of of the seating is in the form of couches, which I'm not a fan of, too coffee-shopish.
(Taco Mac has a better selection, but I wouldn't consider it a bar).
It is a concrete building with large pillars out front.
I said I was coming for lunch the next day and asked if they would have some.
The number of drafts, breath of style, and handling of their beer products is unparalleled in this city.
Selection is the "package" that has been mentioned in my other reviews of "Irish" pubs in the area....
but I am certainly not waiting 2-3 hours on a Saturday morning for it.
And right in the Rising Star of Hartford!
Sure it's phony, and the food is a little pricey.
Once inside, you are overwhelmed at how the sheer beauty and ambiance of the original architecture meshes with the modern touches.

Service was so-so not great beer mind, didn't try the food, but the beer made up for it.
so I asked the receptionist where the carry out items were.
Thank goodness for the complimentary Charm City Circulator!
The beers were fine, but a little pricey.

Lambic/gueze selection is above average for the region.
But we were looking for a place a bit more unique to Charleston.
Even though I arrived during happy hour, the bartender was very quick and didn't mind describing some of the beers that I wasn't familiar with.
They brew a lot of different beers and variations of their beers.
Atmosphere - the location is not ideal by any means.
While it's rich, it doesn't have the usual heaviness
The way I see it is that if you are reading any reviews on this site and you are in Brugge?
A lot of the gift stores decor has been put to good use as the decor in this calming environment .
Just as previous posters said, 6 aisles of beer!
The Oud Bruin was the specialty and delicious.
It's hard not to like Max's (or Grant's, Elbow Room, or Arugala's all on the same street).
The selection now is second to none and the service is exceptional.
Its like you are in a regular SF bar except with an amazing selection.
It is right across from Camden Yards and very convenient in the inner harbor area.
The house beers themselves range from mediocre to awful, often with obvious flaws such as diacetyl.
Those hopes were dashed after we saw the tiny bar tucked into the corner, which had no more than 8 stools, all of which being occupied.
I had a hot dog that was about half the size of a normal one but was very tasty.
I was happy to see that Falstaff was about a block away from where the missus and I were staying in Paris.
Only draw back is the crowded space, lack of tables, but rumor has it there could be an expansion in the future!
I'd recommend grabbing a brewers choice pack.
Wood bar, wood bar stools, wood chairs at wood tables, the booths are wood with wooden benches.
Very unassuming, and has the aforementioned 7-11 feel.
We never waited much at all for our beers
Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beer.
Looks like an old mill/industrial building outside.
All in all, a very solid choice, particularly for a Friday late lunch heading into an early weekend.
The service is better than a lot of places here.
Went for lunch and it was fairly packed with a mix of tourists and locals.
Had several Founders on tap as well as Sun King.
Top notch service the bartender knew his beers and really knew his mixed drinks, he was obsessed with the mixed drinks.
If you can not get a seat though it can be a little annoying.
so I decided to check out their newest location.
This is the go-to bottle shop in downtown Denver.
New Holland is yet another high quality Southwest Michigan Brewery.

I was in Bend and visiting quite a number of breweries, beer bars, and bottle shops.
Being just down the street we decided to check the place out.

sometimes acoustic, sometimes small jam bands, reggae-funk bands, just a good time all around.
First place we stopped on the way into Albuquerque.
Beer list is impressive and prices are reasonable for the city.
They turned out to be right on cause they have some damn good beers here.
it seems crazy to think the downtown denver scene can support another brewery, yet here we are, and i really cant see it not working out for these guys.
About a dozen tables and a bar that seats seven or eight.
so it's never a hassle to get out to Societe... plus
when you're in the area, it's well worth a small detour.

The food was excellent and the service was good.

This bar is very conveniently located in the square near the St. Jacobs Church, a few doors down from Dulle Gruit.

My only regret is that I showed up after 2 PM which is when they stopped the tasters.
I had heard great things about this place

Having read other reviews, I don't think my experience is common.

Not a ton of 6 packs but they had a healthy supply of Great Lakes Christmas Ale this past week when everyone else was sold out.
Did a little research before taking a trip to Rochester a few weeks ago, & this place seemed to be the best destination.
My wife and I stopped by this place for a beer after taking a long walk on the levee.
so I was thrilled when I found out that they don't keep any BMC on tap (although they do have almost all of them in bottles).
Wow -- I almost wonder from the other reviews if I went to some other place.
I have been to th KBE a few times now and enjoy the wide selction f beers, especially from Michigan Brewers.
Before Willard's you would be lucky to find a bar in the area with one IPA on draft.
On the weekends its usually crowded, but with a great selection of beers on tap who cares, it gives you the opportunity to drink more beer.
Honestly, if I graded this place based on what I've come to expect from Airports, it would be all 5s, no questions.
When you first walk in, there's a smallish sized tasting room with bars for sitting and tables around the floor.
I think they may be a bit north of this number.
They have a lot of beers available, but many are just not very good compared to other places like nearby The Attic
The bartender was friendly enough, if a touch aloof, and I didn't really press him as to his knowledge of the beers.
I was there for a working lunch with my boss.
and because of that, i will come again, and again.
Maybe we were there too early in the day and the deadness of the place just got to me.
Good place with a great view of downtown Richmond.
Vibe was good and waitstaff really know their products on the bottle side and tap room.
Even though they weren't open the owner still allowed us to sit down like it was.
Ashley's was the place where I first discovered that there were beers outside of Yuengling, Coors, and Miller.
I get to the Rochester area about once a year for the past 7 years, but I've yet to make any beer stops.
In an old industrial area in Ybor City, this is a repurposed warehouse.
The food is cheap, and the menu is limited, but things always smell good by the kitchen.
Which is good - not world class, but good.
one of their beers and man was I totally blown away by this place!
but yes I will keep coming back for the selection.
This brewpub is one of the most beautiful interiors I have ever seen.
Spacious aisles, great variety, and helpful staff.
In Kalamazoo that is among the best, if not the best.
I enjoy coming into this store so much, in fact, that I recently decided to leave my corporate job and take a position as their beer manager.
This is up and coming in that distribution will improve, and they will be a factor.
The beer is available for walk out purchase
My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and drink near our hotel, and the connceirge recommended the Irish Embassy.
Too bad, with better service, this place could be incredible.
I went at kind of an off-time, so I could not really get a feel for the atmosphere.
There is about 4 isles of beer from around the world incl local micros.
They go against almost every traditional style of Belgian brewing and go straight for the USofA.
but they were friendly and helpful at checkout.
I like Total Wine, but that's because I live in Florida.
This place seems a bit under the radar, and that should not be the case.
well designed, tasty food, and has a great beer list.
As my ratings indicate, I'm a huge fan of FPBC.
The pizza doesn't look like its anything special but eat a slice or two and you'll say
Being right across the street from Coors Field has certainly helped their business over the years.
This place is small, but there is a nice variety of seating options.
Selection of beer was par but the food was nothing to brag about.
Very good atmosphere, nice tap selection.
This is in a farmers market and shares outdoor space.
Loved hanging out in the old small space on a Friday night with a small crowd tasting a Riwaka forward IPA.
but as soon as you walk in the door you feel like you're in a different place and the crowd is always fun!
Pretty much your average pub, but quite large with very high ceilings (this helps a lot when it's busy
Plus, the bartender didn't say thank you after picking up the check - a big no-no in my book.
I don't see how that is possible right now, but still they have a huge selection.
1 small TV in the corner of the Tavern area which comes in handy for keeping tabs on the Phillies game.
The selection is pretty solid for just stocking German stuff but felt a tad limited.
They have a great selection of beers (especially from the UK), and a very knowledgeable staff.
This place is definitely the best craft beer spot in Charlotte.
The only thing that out weighs it's selection is the man himself, Junior.
They have a few decent beers available that are brewed on location.
Tap room with a bar, high-tops, tables and couches.
Staff was friendly and went out of their way to help me make my selections (it was also early day on a Saturday and thus very low traffic).
I was pleased with the selection of taps that they had and seem to keep current.
Service was friendly and came equipped with never ending smiles and pleasantries.
It's in a fairly seedy part of town but not dangerous.
They have everything from Victory to Hop Rod Rye and Hop wallop and Trappist beer.
Paul does a great job of getting beer into the store.
The owner is super friendly, and the store carries an excellent selection of local, national, and foreign beers.
There's nothing terribly special about the physical place

I stopped in based on the BA review while in the Seattle area on business (I was staying in Renton).
Bustling early-era fish market/restaurant type atmosphere.
Do we really want these breweries representing Minnesota craft brewing?
Only good thing is variety of beer but much of which tastes old or flat.
We It is located on the outskirts of the Hill neighborhood, and was easy to find.
My last visit I rolled in at about 4PM and saw a cool blues band.
since mostly a wine and cheese bar, the vibe is a bit snooty.
Speaking of which, it's a bit overlit and bland, although it's not quite the hotel-lobby horror suggested by the photo on its website.
I was lucky enough to visit on Christmas weekend, so it wasn't insanely busy.
was my go to place during a weeks stay in KZOO
It is a homey place with a bar/dining area along with a separate dining room and a patio out back.
My hotel was very close to this brewpub on a recent vacation to KC, and I thought that that could be a great find.
This place was a nice late-night escape from downtown Asheville, especially with the top notch pizza food truck hitting the spot.
outside which one would forget was there from the atmosphere of the place.
For most of my life, the BBE location was a normal-looking restaurant.
If you are going on a Saturday sign up for a tour, $5 gets you a tulip glass, 4 6 oz pours of anything on tap, and the tour.
Back down from up north, pondering what to do with our day before the flight tonight.
You can hit this place and several others with little more than a light stroll.
I knew when I walked in the door that they were going to have avgood beer selection, but WOW, did I ever hit the #jackpot.
Been a couple of times; the selection is not large and the beer a little above average.
Everyone in my party loved this place each time I have been there.
We had a few items to share and the food was great, although I feel that the portions were a bit small.
It's a great location too, right by the Gran Plaza.
No fault of theirs, but with a ton of good beer spots in the city, just hard to travel to a spot that can be hot or cold.
While we were there the single bartender spent most of his time standing at the top of the stairs smoking with friends.
Also they occasionally will have bottles of stuff that's not on tap.
Bartender was awesome, friendly and knowledgeable.
Was there early evening prior to dinner with friends.
The bar is fairly large in size but was completely packed on a Sunday night.
Plenty of local brews are featured, not all of them but a good chunk.
20 or so selections featuring the likes of Founders, Maine, Smuttynose, Alagash and others.
The atmosphere is fantastic with students familes and sounds abounding.
Fun spot to hit if you're in Speedway (especially during race weeks).
Did a flight and liked the IPA immensely and considered buying a few sixers to take home but didn't because I was stupid.
Gritty's had 6 or 7 of their beers on tap, including their 21 IPA on cask, which I ordered.
Newish to Nashville, some friends recommended it last time I was visiting so we tried it out.
Visited 4/24/09, reviewed from notes, smack dab in the middle of Pearl Street, girlfriend wanted to eat dinner here
Our visit was on a Wednesday evening for a late dinner.
One issue is their quality seems to have plateaued if not slightly declined.
This store is nothing impressive from the outside; in fact, it looks to be as ghetto as Ann Arbor gets.
There is also an outdoor picnic/ game area with additional seating.
You will find this pub tucked away down on Concourse A in the area that serves the Horizon Airline flights.
The place is rather small but I was very surprised at the vast selection of Ale Yeah! considering the size.
Tons of single bottles, which is great if you want to try a bunch of stuff.
But i will say i love some of their beers.
Varga has a very large draft selection of about 25 or so taps.
Small but respectable bottle list and some taps.
All of the beers are served in a handled mug, which is a bit odd.
We stopped in here for a quick pint after walking around the quarter most of the morning and afternoon.
I would definitely recommend this place to those travelling through or to Cincinnatti.
I am adding this spot to my go to when in dallas along with flying saucer and the quarterbar.
Overall, clean, fun, and possibly a meat market for younger types at night.
Firstly, it seems to be more of a neighborhood pizza joint/restaurant than a beer bar.
One of the few places in Brussels still carrying the fading torch of true Belgian "cuisine a la biére", which is nearly on the verge of extinction.
One of the very best beer selections I have ever seen anywhere!
The prices were between reasonable and high, but they offered different serving sizes (3 if I recall right), always appreciated.
Pizza food truck outside was also excellent.
Ten dollars for for a 12 beer flight was a damn good deal, however, only found three of the offerings to be any good.
Great beer, funky atmosphere, and someone found me some stickers on my way out.
The whole Scotty's chain has gone downhill the past year in my opinion, and downtown is no exception.

So after heading out to Brouwers in Green Lake, I returned to downtown and walked up toward Capitol hill and the Stumbling Monk.
A few other good bars in the area, so you can just stumble around for a while if you want.
In Sum: Great beer store staffed by knowledgeable and friendly staff.
The food was all fine, nothing too exciting, but it went well with the beer.
Today we stopped in for a special Stone tapping and we were not disappointed.
Judging by my tasting or drinking of 5 of their offerings, two stouts and 3 German-styles, I give them an A+ for brewing to the style.
The owner Mike is a great guy and knows a ton about beer and is a driving force in the city for local breweries.
Most noteably, the tuesday night "Burger and Brew.
Lots of high top tables and a massive bar.
From the looks of the clientele (sorry for any stereotyping) I'd have to guess the same.
im not sure how the change went down, but this appears to be a major upgrade from bj's, at least as far as i can tell from one visit.
To all those complaining about location, that is intentional.
As mentioned, this place is much cleaner and smells much better than the Pasadena location.
Had a number of German items on the menu, but otherwise, pretty standard brew pub fare.
definitely has that beer hall feel despite being in a house.
Had a founders reds rye, a breakfast stout and loose cannon IPA, all very delicious and fresh.
If you enjoy more of a "meatloaf" styled burger go for it.
I know from the states, but a third, at 4.5%.
Rolled into the Whiskey tavern around 9pm on a Saturday and was surprised at how small it was.
I stayed across the street at Faessla, so this was a pretty easy walk to make.
the service was fine, they were busy but we didnt have to wait long for beers
Indoor and outdoor seating are available and the place is busy (though it does not have the most convenient hours).
They did have some guiness and leni for the unititiated but over the selection was pretty good.
However, you can find some good rotational/seasonal beer, along with some great cask ale that is quite tasty and sessionable.
so we probably lucked out on the intimate tour) and learned about the process from A-Z.
After striking up a conversation with another beer geek, we decided to meet up at White Labs.
I was expecting more from a downtown Indianapolis restaurant.
The production area is at the far end which is nice to see as you enjoy your beers.

It's a blend of rock-a-billy, skater, cafe racer, and locals.
Neat in the winter when the windows fog up inside.
Sometimes I can't believe the places I've forgotten to review.
The tap room was warm and cozy in a modern way.
For the amoutn of people they bring they dont really have the space.
My wife and I make an evening of it, by heading to Chucks, then enjoying dinner at one of Chagrins cozy little spots.
Half way through the meal I ordered a Highlands Cold Mountain Winter Ale and it arrived quickly.
I went here on a Tuesday night for dinner.
I took away a bottled Wheatwine aged in bourbon barrels called Firelight (which I am sampling as I write this) - excellent beer.
It was very spicy and salty, and the fish was either not good
Top notch drinking and dining destination.
The brewery itself is clean and comfortable but nothing to write home about, really, so I'll just speak to the selection.
The only clue that this drug store would have a whole aisle of craft beer is a couple of advertisements on the window outside.
Have been to the Judge's Bench on several occassions now, and have to say that it is a welcome addition to the West Baltimore beer scene.
This place had a reql cool vibe and an attentive staff.
I usually get one beer and leave because of the ridiculous waiting in multiple lines.
I assume expecting a smile would be asking too much.
A series of windows all of the way forward overlooked King Street.
This place was great because the server did a nice job of explaining the beers, and recommending new beers based on preferences.
i hope these guys start getting busy, for all the new breweries that have opened here lately, there really isnt anything like this, and we need it.
I visited Story Tavern yesterday after Gordon Biersch (which is literally right across the street).
As you walk in the bar is on the right and accommodates about 10-12 people.
A very good bottle selection, and though not that many taps the quality was good with a couple harder to gets.
THe bartender did not even acknowledge our existence for at least 5 minutes, and it wasn't that crazy busy.
so I got to smell the beer being brewed the whole time I was there.
The bartender said it gets really busy during the evenings, but there were people at about half of the tables when we were there.
Found Tilquin Oude Gueuze & 2013 Bigfoot sitting on the shelf!
We walked in, grabbed a table, and were waited on quickly.
The staff and management were friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.
I would say that the import list needs some additions.
The selection on tap and in bottles is alright, nothing that is hard to find.
It's a place I love to hate and hate to love, though.
The exchange uses a stock market style pricing system that adjusts the price of the beer base on demand every 20 minutes.
Next to the world's largest strip mall and countless sports bars in the area, I NEVER thought I'd see this here.
They use appropriate glassware and the taps are clean.
It's clean and new with a decent amount of seating, and if you enter from the parking side, you get a great view of the brewing facilities as you walk into the taproom.
A bit one-note due to their focus, and on a Sunday afternoon they were clear about trying to get us going, but overall a cool place with good beer.
I can say with some good certainity that this is a part of NYC that I had never been to before.
Thomas' is a super cool place with a great selection and Fitty

About 8-10 offerings from session to barrel aged stuff.
The whole Catholic theme is fun (save the poor waitresses, who look pretty miserable in their ill-fitting school girl uniforms), and I dig the stained glass and dark wood.
(we went with a group that had 4 kids 2 and under.
I don't dislike stadium's per se, but I hate being reminded of how I was swindled into buying one for a billionaire.
They have a good Brown, Red, Porter, and a GREAT Hop Dog beer.
As far as the staff you can forget about any sort of help from them.
Above the bar was the name of the place, writ large in stainless steel.
Square footage gets cut in half when the patio is closed or too cold to be used.
The wait staff is friendly and the bartender are attentive.
Once you enter the building you have a gift shop and place to purchase beers to go.
It's located right on Broadway, in the middle of downtown.
i liked their farmhouse ipa, and thought the coffee stout and strawberry belgian blonde were also nice, all very drinkable and seemingly quite professionally done.
They usually have about 10 beers on tap at any given time and the tap station is just one of the coolest designs I've seen.
... seems like Nepenthe is more interested in the 'scene' rather than the beer.
though, I found them all to be generic and weak in some ways, under carbonated, and similar in a bad way.
The food is always excellent and service is great.
The food is flad-out outstanding, near perfect, but the pricing is unreasonable in all of West Hartford.
It's wonderful to have a bar with a solid lineup of craft beer in the University area.
but there are a lot of food and drink specials for locals in certain businesses like gaming and UNLV - and gamblers as well.
This place is tucked in a hard-to-find spot south of Huntington Ave near the Longwood medical area.
Beautiful location in historic Third Ward.
It's across the street from Belching Beaver and half a block from Helm's.
And a very minor one at that, in fact it works to an advantage here as many of the nearby establishments are chain joints.
The people who both work there and patron are unpretentious.
Went on a Sunday afternoon and barely any crowd but it seemed intimate and lively (I don't think I'd like to be here on a crowded Saturday night, though).
I live 2 blocks away which is a blessing and a curse.
They also have a growler fill station with some good beers on tap.
They actually have two locations and I visited both of them.
They usually have Penn Pilsner, Penn Dark, Stoudts Scarlet Lady ESB and 2 macros on tap.
Place was busy the entire time, not stuffed, but people at each table and at the bar.
I highly recommend going to T&P and enjoying the beer selection.
The place itself is fairly nice and I would definitely go there with friends for some beers and whatnot
Visiting Hartford CT from PA and wanted to sample some local brews, so I consulted BA for advice.
Spotted some Stone tap handles and such while walking through NYNY en route to Mandalay Bay, and decided to stop on the return trip.
The food is a tad pricey but its worth it.
If I find myself in the area in need of beer
They looked into the problem, fixed it, and got him a fresh one free of charge.
Now to just bring a much bigger suitcase next time!
seriously, the place is just an old house converted to store.
Service is good and the bartenders are friendly and are very knowledgeable about the beers they serve.
Also, almost all their beers are available for purchase to go (all beers available in 750s while Ozzy and Resurrection are available in 6pk cans).
They do offer 1/2 off bottles from 3 to 6 on weekdays.
As other reviews mentioned, the $3 beers are served in pairs of small mugs.
Also within (healthy) walking distance to a White Sox game as well if that's your jam.
I sadly have to leave when I get hungry, and walk to Canton square for a bite to eat when the time comes.
The atmosphere is what I would call simple pub comfortable.
They have seating at the bar and an upstairs as well as outside picnic table seating.
Brought home a few bottles that I can't get in Chicago.

Conenient in the downtown area if you have a car.
the Kern River Brewing Co. The sales person said they were allocating one per customer.
Located in downtown Berkeley literally on top of the BART and one block from campus.
Quite friendly and very well informed barkeep.
I was impressed with the layout of the taproom/brewery, the selection of beer, and the service.
Nice large brewpub in the middle of the Main Street Station Casino.
The interior of white walls with little carvings and subtle decoration along with the gold colored pilar tops are well preserved.
It's not that they're inaccurate, but I guess I just see some of the "problems" in a somewhat different light.
I think they have a very good selection of beer including craft styles.
The beer guy here Lon definitely knows what he is doing and works to bring in the best he can.
The tap list is always exciting, but never wet-your-pants exciting.
You can do flights of pizza, which is awesome!
The selection is amazing and if they dont have what you want, they'll order it for you.
with bottles nothing really stood out as unique or out of the range of local liquor stores.
The quality is excellent compared what one would expect from an airport.
The Bass Lake Draft House is a comfortable spot in the middle of Holly Springs.
I had the bison burger and thought it was very good.
buried in a quasi-upscale stripmall (on one hand you have wine markets, cigar stores, and birkenstock outlets and on the other you sprawl mart)
The tables are scattered throughout and are of different sizes which is helpful for small and large parties.
and I can't stand to eat in a smoke filled place.
The place is fairly empty during the week and has a medium crowd on the weekends.
They would keep track of how many beers you had by making tick marks on your coaster in pencil.
I know, you can't find rare beers or bottles here, but there are a ton of taps, the food is great and
When you walk in you're greeted with full shelves and a "New Arrival" display, a big plus for beer hunters.
Go there early, order several beers at a time, and be prepared to wait.
Large tap selection of in-house brews, all of which are above average.
although not the most exciting, they still have one of the best selections of beer in town, and decent prices.
Bottle selection second to none and priced.
There is a bar about 100' long that houses two sets of 10 or so taps near each end with another larger set of 30 or so taps in a bank of two rows behind the bar.
If you're in the area, make it a point to stop in and see what they've got to offer!
The beers are pretty good but not stellar and the food is pretty decent.
Choice one was an interesting rye based Saison with some Bret.
The bartenders are very helpful with some great recommendations.
I was a bit surprised by the design of Lucky Labs northwest expansion.

Part of a walking bar crawl with Allen Street Hardware Cafe and Presca
service was next level, super accommodating to my asks (wifi access, phone charger, samples...)
Food is their mainstay with great burgers, wings, chili, etc.
space-wise they're limited here, with the entire store compromising about the area of a bedroom, and most of that is taken up by wine and spirits.
The shelves filling the store have a good order to them and hold lots of good, well selected beer.
Prices are reasonable, although I seem to break the bank every time I go into the store because I have to try all their new stock.
The atmosphere is good too, as the beer/liquor is in its own room aside from the busyness and noise of the grocery market.
Or mild fire-roasted salsa and tequila for that matter.
Stopped here while visiting Copenhagen in September 2016.
But, hey, I'm in Rochester, I'm going to go to Chuck's place
The beer selection is fantastic and the service is top notch.
It is a more recent entry to the Beervana scene and is a welcome one for my experience.
Ive been pretty luck that every time I go in

The is a long bar against the right wall and seating around the bar.
Vitaly & Masha are always so welcoming and friendly..
w/ the place but not a real high grade b/c, simply, the beer and food are good, not great.
Bartenders are responsive, cheerful, and will serve you until you are laying on the floor.
The quality is superb; while most offering are wild ales, there are a handful of other non-sour options, all quality.
They really do a great job of balancing flavors and bringing in ingredients that are a little out there... but still work.
Perfect to hit up after a Cubs game, which is exactly what we did....multiple rooms, and areas, plenty of out door space...
That said, they do have just about everything you would need to make perfectly good homebrew.
Don't buy the single bottles off the shelf/display area.
First class food here at The Publican - this is somewhere for meat lovers, as you might expect from the name.
There is also seeting upstairs, but I have not been privy thus far.
Not a bad spot for a great beer at a decent price, just try not to spill beer on someones laptop.
I first went and bought some food, very nice stuff, lots of organic.
Well lit but the store is still a bit disorderly and you do have to look closely to find some beers, but there's a great selection of domestic and foreign beers.
I will definitely be returning time and time again.
Torrential downpour, standing water in the streets kinda thing.
but I had to 'settle' for what I could carry back up the hill in a knapsack.
Most of the taps don't seem to rotate that frequently, but there's usually at least a few different beers each time I go.
Rocket Fuel Vietnamese coffee is incredible!
I give this 5 out of 5 rings on the Planet Scott Rings Around Uranus scale.

I remember when this place was the Salty Dog.
This restaurant on Sendlinger Strasse, is only a few minutes walk from Marienne platz and the Town Hall, or a few minutes walk from the Sendlinger Tor U-Bahn station.
Bar food is great - good burgers, cheese curds and mac and cheese on offer to offset the beers you will enjoy.
We had the pretzels with the awesome beer mustard.
It's all one large room - a lot of tables, booths and chairs to sit in, ample space for quite a few people.
Once we finally made our way in there it was shoulder to shoulder.
They took an old warehouse and turned into a destination for East Village dining.
This is a bustling little joint located in the heart of the Short North.
The bar is on one side and sports 18 bar stools.
Kind of a long, narrow bar with patio in front.
It's in a neighborhood of Detroit that is far removed from downtown, close to Grosse Point.
I had a few of them and they were all above average.
With that, expensive prices come hand in hand.
Probably my favorite place in Indy to have a beer or 3 with some friends(might be biased though since it's a 5 minute walk from my house.
Store is neatly organized, while the selection may not overwelm there is representation of most regions and styles.
Comforting, at least to my sensibilites despite its shotgun shape.
It's a true American Craft Beer bar - they do have bottles of Unibroue lying around on occassion...
It has a great atmosphere, pretty laid back, sordove odd shaped.
There may not be many taps, but the beer flowing from them is quality stuff (though I can't now remember specifics).

Graze is the latest place to eat if you want to tell people where you had dinner.
Little place at the zipline start of the Fremont Street experience.
Theres noting wrong with the food but its sometime too much cash for a few beers and food.
Definitely try the sloppy tacos, cheap and satisfying.
Decent atmosphere with tables in each side of the room and a bar in the middle.
The pizza is sooo good, thin and floppy and very very tasty.
It is a nice building decorated with old fashioned mementos, music is oldies instrumentals and has a nice window to the clean brewing area.
or I can come with my wife and kids and my dog too.
I've seen better beer stores, but you're sure to find something great
great outdoor patio during the summer months.
Food was good, I had the mussels with chorizo though they could have gone a little easier on the ginger.
Nice design and fun bar area that felt more cozy than it actually was.
They boast of 80 bottles, but the draft list by itself is enough for a couple nights of drinking.
What all of the time, partially because I really like it, and partially because it is a block from my apartment.
Prices were quite reasonable for craft brews.
The new Comstock brewery is much bigger, but this is the spot you want to go to.

A little on the average-high side of pricing for some things, but way cheap for others.
The Bishop's Collar is a quaint little pub in a location that goes way back!
It has the look of an old store on the inside.
Rustic and woody, there is plenty of natural light, but the dark wood seems to suck some of that out and keep it a little more cozy.
But, there is only one person taking orders at one time, so if there's a line, it can take several minutes inside this small brewery to get your drink.
So, I tend to get the more obscure stuff here that I don't see elsewhere.

16oz pints for between $3-5.25 which I think is more than fair for draft micro-brews.

When I checked the Brew Pub out, I was a pleasantly surprized by it.
Actually one of my favorite breweries in town.
What I can say however about this shop, is that the owner, Sid is simply the most affable beer geek I've ever came across anywhere.
the strong arm ipa and brute ipa were both great, while the brett michaels saison was totally underwhelming, and the lagers we had were also solid.
A nice gas fireplace adds warmth to the atmosphere.
The food alone would have been awesome, but the beer pairings pushed it over the top.
Well worth a visit if you find yourself in Brussels.
I think the very friendly and personable bar tender mentioned that there is an upstairs bar as well, with a few more tap handles.

I remember it that well even to this day.
The way they set up the tap list is cool.
There's nothing like having a couple and playing with macaroni and glue.
Current tap and bottle list kept on their website.

The beers as covered here are passable, not worth going out of your way for, but what needs addressing is the service.
The first time I was there they had the Ms. Lovin which was phenomenal, it had a great peanut butter taste and was nice and thick.
I went down to hear what everyone was talking about.
The atmosphere is cramped, small, and very woody.
Someone other than the employee I was talking to answered my question by yelling it across the room
Definitely better on tap then in a bottle.

All of the beers I tried were served at a good temperature and in proper glassware.
Then again, if I could get away with it, those would probably be my priorities, too.
They also have a very good selection of European/Belgian beers, as would be expected, but the emphasis is clearly to be an American beer bar first.
Awesome food to go along with awesome beer.
Sunday we venture out at a time dangerously close to breakfast to sample yet more of Beervana's (that's Portland if you are wondering) breweries.

Their selection of meats and cheeses is excellent.
The food is expensive but worth every penny.
For being so small, this place packs a LOT of beer!
Small space, but has to be one of the top places to get fresh cask ale in the US.
It’s cool to go into a wine bar and get world-class beer treatment.
An interesting lineup of beers and virtually all are very well made.
I will say that the menu at lunch time was very limited with only three entrees and a soup available.
There a few coolers in the back of this main room with mainly NY bombers and 4/6 pks.
I didn't try the food though I've heard it's great.
It's a workable model, and with some extra space inside, there's potential that the inventory grows over time.
I've been coming here for about a year, and it's far and away
I just got back from the Sour, Lambic, and Berliner Weiss Festival held at the Cajun Café.
im not sure how distinct this is from what anyone else is doing in the area, but i liked it here and would return if i ever had more than a day or two in the city.
The design was unimpressive as there was no view of the brewery operations/equipment.
It clearly had a locals feel, with British focus on the ale selection of course.
He was more like an enthusiastic amateur rather than a professional waiter, but maybe he was new.
Well lit, as opposed to the majority which turn them down and likely to encourage drinking.
I would HIGHLY recommend visiting and having an event at Legal Draft!
We actually just randomly found it because we saw people sitting outside eating.
Dominion, Victory, some nice imports, nothing too exotic.
Dennis is super down to earth and accommodating.
The other drawback is that the service downstairs is also not the best there are times where no one stops by to offer to take your order.
Visited on 11/8/2015 - it's basically down the street and around the corner from De Biertempel.
$5 for a very filling sliders and fries meal, sure.
I usually go to the Old Grove BP location, but thought I would check out Miramar after hearing good things.
A bar upstairs on Oxford Street, Darlinghurst, near Taylor Square.
It's right down the street from Banger's, which is one of my favorite places, so that's a bonus, especially as they don't serve food.
Me and three friends took one of their huge wooden tables.
In the Old Town not far from several other Prague classic pubs, like U Vejvodu and Zlateho Tygra.
The bar staff are decent but lack knowledge of their product but were willing to be flexible and get the kitchen to make a substitution on a dish.
I found a GREAT place when I came across this bar.
This is a classic bar in the old school USA sense, long central bar with tons of tall chairs along it, some tables against another wall, and a few pool tables in back.

knowledgable staff, always a plus...comfortable place with a larger outdoor area...loved the vibe and basically everything about this place...just go
I will be bac to this place, the owner seems like a good guy.
Original large tasting room, and a new roof top deck, the meadow, and upper level tasting/event rooms.
Probably, the in-your-face unpretentiousness that is obvious right off the bat.
Certainly not bad by any stretch, but there are plenty of better choices in town.
Worth going a little out of your way for.
The live music is an attraction not just background.
And the main attraction, the beer, far exceeded our already high expectations.
Hopslam on tap, and available in bottle for purchase.
Annette the beer manager and cicerone is always helpful and worth chatting with.
We could have grabbed a table if we were more vigilant
They made a conscious decision not to serve food, which is a bummer, but when food trucks are there that makes it easier to hang out a while.
This is a nice little shop at Pike Place Market.
Two separate trips have had the waiter buy us a round of schnapps and their suggestions for food/beer pairings have never led me astray.
It was a Saturday at 3pm right after the brewery had opened and the place was already buzzing and bustling.
Monday pint nights are a real bargain at $3.
Their beer selection is nice, and the price is nicer.
They have snacks and what not available, mostly chips and jerkey, which is typical of a liquor store.
I made like Moses and parted the Patio Sea in order to head inside to the bar.
(I think they do it seasonally), because they're a big chain.
This market has a very good beer selection with bottles ranging from European imports to local offerings.
I came here on a business trip and was pleasantly happy with my experience.
We sat at a table this time and the bartender and server were both very helpful and knowledgable throughout the night.
I am surprised that Taft's Ale House does not have higher reviews.
Lots of stained-glass or frosted windows, so you can't really see in.
They even gave everyone on the tour a bottle of Ayinger Weizenbock!
On the other side of the shrine grounds, take a left at the first street, and Beer House Ken will be on your right in half a block or so.
I will warn you though, apparently until they upgrade some costly equipment the ABC will only let them pour in plastic cups.
did I know it isn't kosher to have 4 pints and head back to work for the afternoon.
If you find yourself on the Loop, stop by to have a Stag and some fried mushrooms but don't go here thinking they are a true beer bar.
the bar is small as well with typically 6ish offerings all made in house!
The best thing about this place is the selection of hoppy beers.
No time for a bite to eat, but the food looked to be interesting and perhaps a notch or two above typical pub grub.
For food, I split mussels and spicy sriracha peas, both of which were delicious.
it has a strange positioning in the midst of an enormous parking lot perched at one of the busiest corners for car traffic in the town.

They always have interesting beers on tap (no BMC if you care).
They have daily pint specials and rotate your more well
The night I was there Lake Louie, The Great Dane and Capital were all represented on tap.
I visited the Church Brew Works for the first time on a Sunday in Feb, 2017.
Service was good, but they were not busy.
This Spec's is just like 9/10 that you will find from SA to Galveston to Houston to Austin, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
Not that other businesses haven't done a good job, but they weren't the kind of places that build a solid, loyal customer base.
It was actually pretty full, with most of the tables in use.
A really nice place to go to whenever I'm in the area.
we loved their ginger wheat, their strawberry basil hefe, and a couple of their hazy hoppy offerings as well.
Usually on wednesdays or thursdays they have dollar bottles of some pretty good beer(I've
There is nothing like enjoying a fine Belgian beer sitting on the canal.
cool little place i stopped at on my trip in MI.
Time and a place for all things, this place is for a relaxed glass or two of good beer.
Very tasty; but banana and nettle beer is not my thing.
Good selection and worth the trip for sure.
If you plan on frequenting, bring your own glass(up to 20 oz.)
Seriously - this is one of my favorites for the food, the atmosphere, the beer, and the people.
I thought it was easy to find, there was plenty of parking as well.
There is something about this small store with taps and a few tables I liked.
I was disappointed that they didn't have any Hopslam he went in the back and got me some of his private stash!
Thick crust (not Chicago style), not thin, quality ingredients.
I was surprised to see that neither one had even been added as a beer on this site either, encouraging me to go back and have some more of the more obscure beers.
Four large TVs, but unfortunately the only thing on was tennis.
I stopped in during a recent visit to Edmonton.
Despite a drab environment outside the building, the interior has life.
I've been quite a few times and never been disappointed.
The interior boasted exposed brick, ducting, and wood beams, as well as a huge skylight.
On a Thursday, it was not crowded at 4:30, but filled up rapidly.
The food is pub grub, just OK, but not better than that.
Then they also have a huge cooler of takeout beer.
He's always more than happy to show me whats new or what he has in the back.
I've been excited to visit Reubens for about a year now after being very impressed with all their hoppy offerings I had had.

Last time we went, we had a great time at the original Laurelwood joint.
He is a bit dry and gets directly to the point, but has a wealth of knowledge.
This Trader Joe's occupies what used to be a favorite bookstore of mine- a sprawling Barnes & Noble with a Starbucks coffee, a killer used-book section and the works.
I ALWAYS will check the price before asking for the beer.
I know I can still get a beer much tastier than BMC.
The staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.
Oh yes, check out the self cleaning toilets - I want one!!!
We are in a place of business before closing.-
My wife and I went here for dinner the first night we arrived in KC for a quick vacation.
It has been a welcome change, in my book.

Easy to get to, small but excellent selection of local beers and friendly people.
They're making their own kits now (both extract and all-grain) which are reasonably priced and are really high quality.
Steak Frites were very good, and maybe asking for real Belgian frites in Raleigh is too much, but in time I wouldn't be surprised.
Beer selection is best in town, and most are beers you want to actually drink (no macro-brews on tap).
Had a cuppla roomates at college that made a book from their beer notes.
After a surprisingly (mostly) dry night during our Asheville camping extravaganza, and a nice morning hike, my fiancé and I headed to some of the outlaying brewpubs.
Just try not to go when it's too crowded.
Stopped here while in Maine visiting family.
Pretty easy to get too, but the parking was pretty limited to side streets.
The quality of beers available is stunning and the service is easily the friendliest and most knowledgeable
Beertenders were helpful with good advice.
I bought a 24 pack of IPA's by Minhas for $4.99.
While only a few of their beers really stand out, it's clear that each was executed well and with care.
It's your typical Irish-bar look-alike you see popping up everywhere.
Wilbur's is likely the biggest liquor store in town
If you snuggle into that criterion, then give it a shot; just be sure to go with a group.
Pliny the Elder, just as number 8 on the draft board?
The brewery is reallly small so it's not great, but they currently have one of my all time favorite beers in tap.
BMC and Euro standards, Schlafly, O’Fallon, Lagunitas, other American micros, and some Belgians.
Decided to pop in here for some dinner after the KTG release.
We were checked in on several times and received our beers and food promptly.
This is probably my favorite eating/drinking establishment anywhere.
They were all solid, nothing outstanding.
Inside it was nice place, although they were understaffed and the employees didn't seem very knowledgeable about beer.
Go here and enjoy one of the best you'll ever find!

but there ere about a dozen or so 'business casual' gentleman and ladies unwinding after a hard day in the office.
My wife and I were visiting family in the Baltimore area

and it's clear the employees really love this company.
Few things there that are not on the shelf.
Knowing little about Texas beer, I bought nearly two dozen random singles to stuff in my luggage.
The interior of the bar is perfectly dark and looks like a pub should.
It's not a world class beer and bottle shop, or a must-stop destination, Corks & Kegs is a better local choice for that.
They've got a few TV's inside and one on the outside.
Pricing tend to be on the higher side of reasonable.
Nice to see a brewery with a variety of year round beers along with plenty of seasonal/rare beers to sample.

Many Indiana beers were on the list, as well as several others: my favorite was the Chocolate Stout from People's brewing, but Brugge's Harvey Sour was quite awesome, too.

It's somewhat smaller than other Whole Foods, so the number of items, including craft beers they carry seem to be proportionally smaller.
Ten taps of local beer so the pickings aren't great but they don't waste time with easy to find local beer, either, and the bottle/can selection isn't shabby.
The beer selection wasn't all that great Canadian and some local beers

The Lost Abbey/Port brewing have a cool thing going here.

Most definitely this place will be my base camp in Atlanta when there next.
Plus, happy hour is every day and all day on Sunday!
They had pool, ping pong, and other games in different rooms around the place.
Would have liked to have seen it when things were "normal".
The heating and cooling in this room can be very hit or miss, and stays a little warmer during the hot months of summer.
By the looks of it, they have pool tournaments for time to time, or week?
They said they get KBS, FBS, and possibly CBS.
Stopped here while in Pasadena, hoping to find something cool.
The tap list is incredibly extensive now with two bars each having around 15 taps with different beers at each.

One of the best things to emerge in the Rochester beer scene in quite some time.
Not like most tap bars in that every brew was served in the glass that best influenced the full flavor of the beer not just pints and mugs.
an interesting little spot here, stopped in for a couple of beers while we were in the neighborhood.
I wouldn't say I was particularly blown away by anything I saw available, but the list was decently solid.
I had a Hoplosion IPA and a Max Burger, which were excellent.
It is a pretty standard chain brewpub in all aspects of its existence.
They don't serve their own food but usually have a good selection of food trucks on any given night.

Just a chalkboard describing the fifty beers on tap.
The brewpub is right on the spree river and next to the statues of St George slaying the dragon.

There is often live bands on the weekends and they have free wireless internet access.
but thay do have a nice selection of local and regional brews beer
Many of the patrons are Brits that come in to socialize and have a few (Imperial) pints of ale.
Though we've never had anything other than the pizza, I can say it has always been very good.
A very busy Sam Smith's pub with beautifully restored Victorian architecture below with lots snugs and nooks, and beautiful glass work.
That said, the management could work on the glassware a little - in availability, but also in training.
surprisingly big on the inside, bar on the left, table area on the right.
Two beers that ended up being at the top of my list of favorites were discovered here.
but i did not have a chance to get into that.
Also had some warm Christmas beers from Mikkeller and Corsendonk on a shelf next to the fridge.
Very broad offering of styles, rotating guest taps, both Indy and outside IN micros.
It's big, open, airy, with some good decorative touches without being cluttered.
This is one of the big Brew Pub chains that have lasted and seems to be doing well because they keep popping up.
They've even helped me carry stuff out to my car when I would have made two trips to get everything.
It got hot and was the yuppie joint to drink at.
Suggests to get your pint or two and move on, not hang out.

They have a good selection of many beers that are difficult to find elsewhere in Jacksonville, too.
They keep their draft list current on their website.
Went to their annual beer fest on 11/7 and decided to stay for dinner.
The price was very reasonable at $6 for four 4oz pours.
There was a fairly big crowd with a wide variety of ages - 20s to 60s, if I had to guess.
Despite the excessive ID checking, our server was awesome -
That'll get your $4 pitches (i think that's what they are, maybe 6), either way a goood deal.
Its a little cramped but considering they have a very nice selection it works just fine.
New food in the kitchen is a step above and not to be missed.
Store employees were very helpful and I came home to OH with some great beers
This is just a really cool place with a cool vibe, though the space is kind of chopped up in a way that is a little less than perfect.
I wish we could've stayed here longer for a second flight.
Bought a sampler and their beers were solid, although IPAs probably were the winner here...
On the recommendation from Ninkasi Marty, so thank you.
De Vinos & the place directly across the street from them, Virginia Market, both have it for $10 - $11.
The major problem that I had was the same problem I've lways had with Singlecut, and that would be consistency.
The Saloon manages to be both completely unpretentious while still giving a damn about what they are doing.
Parking was a little tight, but once you find a place you won't have to go anywhere else until 10:00 when they close.
I had high hopes for this place concidering that it is nice looking, run by a great company and in West Hartford Center.
Staff is incredibly knowledgeable and experienced.

As City Lounge is a non-smoking establishment the beer garden is open year round for all your tobbacco needs.

I had a much better experience at this location than I had at the other location.

Tried several locals including a porter on cask.
I’m not at all bitter about the time I spent at school in Providence, but reflecting on my college career
Great location in historic Over The Rhine in downtown Cincinnati.
Great hidden gem off a back alley near union square.
Be prepared to wait a bit for service, but with a vibe this amazing, this great a selection, and this much fun to be had you won't mind a bit of a wait.
In the back is the fairly formidable beer section, where the regular craft sixers are in the fridge, and the bombers and rare bottles are on racks.
Great place my daughter took me there while I was visiting with her.
enjoyable spot to sling back a few brews.
You walk in to see chefs twirling pizza dough casually and see that the bar is right next to this "kitchen".
Everyone I encountered was courteous and helpful.

At one point I was the only one, but there were generally 3 to 5 people including myself.
Good selection on tap and bottles; nice and polite customer service.
Goose Island was the first craft beer brewery in Chicago and always will be a place that I have great memories of.
many random bottled beers to choose from.
Also had an employee offer me an imperial stout when they were out of captains daughter which is an imperial IPA.
Just wish they would have a couple extreme or standout beers to choose from.
The food was pretty good as well, and I'd have no trouble stopping back by for a bite of dinner and a couple of beers on a future trip.
The food at Harts is good with my burger being very tasty
Small liquor shop, decent beer sellection.
The basement has a beautifully finished lounge with another bar.
Upon entering I was a bit overwhelmed as there is a TON of beer, liquor and wine in that medium sized store.
Overall, I wish there were better options in the area
The giant brewery/university complex has one major restaurant and a biergarten.
It gets super crowded for dinner, especially if you want to hang out in the bar area.
They also do wine and beer making classes at local libraries on occasion.
We ate outdoors on the patio in December, food was spicy and tasty, beer was average, wait was a tad long.

Nice place, servers seemed knowledgeable enough.
Drinking, eating, and sleeping in school.

Even their signs outside refer to it as a wine/espresso bar...
Excellent food made with natural ingredients.
Maria's is a tiny little liquor store with a good selection at decent prices.
servers are very knowledgeable and friendly.
The selection is a little limited by space, but what they have is good.
Its small and cozy (capacity 85) with the bar and 14 or so tables all in one room, which is OK because this place is SMOKE FREE.
place also focuses on whiskies and cocktails.
Kudos to the management if that was their intention on training the staff on the importance of refilling a guest's glass in a timely manner.
Bar seat about 15 with several large communal tables and booths lining the far wall of taproom.
As for the prices, this place being near the VCU campus I anticipated the prices being in the near expensive to expensive range.
Had some really nice Charcuterie choices which paired well with the beer.
A large and convenient downtown location, that was fairly busy on the 4th day.
The menu was by no means complex, but there was a great variety of burgers to try (I had the Bleu 'Shroom, and highly recommend it) and the food was great.
The hidden nooks, narrow corridors, steep stairways and myriad of rooms can attest to the truth of that.
We sat at the bar and had enlightening conservation with the very friendly staff.
Love it, can't wait til next year if they do the combo again!
The selection of food and beer was also great.
That said, fantastic beer selection and good service.
Tap list is projected above the bar and is legible from almost anywhere in the taproom space.
it was very boozey and nothing like any Guldan Draak I had ever had before.
And lastly, there were 30 beers on tap (more in bottles), and all thirty were craft, no crap.
Stopped in here for a few drinks the other day.
Here is another great German institution in the St Bens neighborhood.
maybe went here when they were a little too new still, its only been a month or so, and there are obviously still some kinks being worked out.
someplace I could get a good beer rather than the biker bars I usually go to that
One of my favorite breweries and place to hang out in Winston.
they don't carry any breweries full line up (and they only have one of Schell's beers available in twelve pack).
The shop is a short walk from the Grand Place, but a bit harder to find than Bier Tempel, especially at night.
the taps had alot of local stuff like indeed
Also have a new flavor injector for mixing flavors of your choice into draft beers.
Had a fried chicken sandwich that was very good on a fresh pretzel roll with an amazing habanero mustard on the side.
Parking is tough as you basically need to park on the street in downtown Portsmouth.
Located a few miles away from the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter this place is a nice change of pace from Bourbon Street.
Best fish fry in town, great burgers and pizza too.
We were there on a Tuesday afternoon and there were a number of people there taking a tour and a few of us sampling beers.
Food & Friends is much more than just a place to buy beer, and although there are other small markets around, this one is clean and pretty nice looking inside.
Beer is really excellent, but popularity is getting to the place.
Perfect place to bring some friends for an afternoon and play some bar games and drink beer.
(I wouldn't walk there at night unless I was carrying).

The bar seems to be solely staffed by the friendly blonde lady that has worked in the various bars of the Dane County airport for a decade and maybe more.

the prices are fair but in some scenarios they can be very expensive ( dfh aprilhop comes to mind)
I got a pork chop that was covered in gravy and sauerkraut, the server offered beer suggestions, and we all left full and satisfied.
I walked in and colleague of mine from school was working and
We had a fantastic time at Liberty Station!
There is even a ghost story that adds to the feel of the place.
Relatively spacious with plenty of seating (inside and outside).
They have a few beers on tap, nothing special here.
I highly recommend this store to anyone in the Hartford area looking for great service and great selection.
but how can you worry about ambiance when it is elbow to elbow drinkers, most of which are drinking macro beers and don't care about quality.
They treat you like you're welcome there.
I visited this brewpub having great hopes of experiencing a jewel brewpub, but was greatly disappointed in the beer.
There were no prices or tags on anything; and although you could ask, it was often quite difficult as they sell just as many cigarettes, chips, and soda as they do beer.
Interesting architecture, lots of big windows that look both outside and into the hotel.
I live very close to the Beer Express and buy from them on a regular basis.
After wanting to stop by this palce for a few years worth of visits to the bay, I finally got the chance to.
There is evidence of a mug club, but its just baffling.
pretty awesome - Oskar Blues, Avery, and Ska were some of the standouts.
(haven't found my tasting notes on that one yet).
Yup, they’ve certainly got the location part down.
I was quite impressed with what they had, and I chatted with their beer guy for a bit who told me he was new there are really working on pumping up the selection.
If I lived in Boston, this is where I would hang out.
Very small selection at this particular Whole Foods.
Most of the floorspace was dedicated to wine.
There are always free tours happening and they encourage you to browse around the brewhouse (carefully of course).
Friendly website even lists recipes for each beer!
If you like saisons and brett this is a nice place to grab a pour and a few bottles; pretty good to excellent sour beers, a very good lager and ok hops.
large selection of appetizers, including sushi.
A pretty cool location a very long and skinny building.
We met many new friends here from all over the world.
A wonderful showcase of Dutch craft beer!
What a terrible burden for a bar to have to deal with, right?

I stopped by today on a whim while returning to Maryland from hiking in the commonwealth.
So I went to this location on a saturday night after being at a homebrew rally all day.
place has a way to go as far as keeping people .
the bar area is decorated in dusty bottles and other old beer items.
A bit on the pricey side (beer in the concert venue was about like the ballpark--$5 a glass).
This bar really has it all, one of the premiere beer bars in NYC, gets to play host to events like Cantillon day, and even a Hill Farmstead tap takeover.
Stopped in on October 4th with my branch manager on a Nor.
I discovered that for a young punk of barely 21, there were plenty of oddball and new beers to try.
Big Bierhalle with room for lots of beer drinkers.
They keep the taplist rotating constantly, and food has steadily improved over their years, which is an achievement, being one of the smallest locations.
Solid place to stop for all food needs, and to get BA worthy beer replenishments
Pinthouse Pizza is a fantastic brewpub with some good pizzas to boot.
It's in the town of Great Falls, which is regarded as ritzy locally, though the Brogue certainly isn't.
I went around dinnertime and found a seat at the bar.
The decor and the bar are unparalleled in their beauty.
All beers i have ever ordered were under five bucks.
Ted's is an awesome shop with great staff and excellent service.
All this because they want to jump on the Craft Beer Ban wagon.
The server screwed up our order in a couple of ways but it was remedied.
At the end of the tour you get a glass of their Brugse Zot beer, which was pretty tasty.
I can think of a few others nearby with fewer taps by half, but better lists.
They also seemed to have a good deal of wine around, but I cant comment too much on that.
The price is on-par with most stores in the area.
it's meant to be an English pub (indeed all of the bartenders I spoke with were British) and has a very clean and warm atmosphere.
The food is pretty good-mostly sandwiches.
You could, for example, stop in, sit down and start with an order of deep fried cheese curds or perhaps a selection of WI cheese.
Buzy times are after work, people are not so much session drinkers these days in town.
Both food and drink prices are reasonable, especially during happy hour.
I'm pretty sure this place used to be a liquor/deli back in the day (when Windmill Farms next door was Stumps).
I had the American dip and my wife had the Lobster Grilled Cheese.
18/8/17 with the wife while eclipse chasing.
I don't contribute often, however I felt I had to chime in on this bar's already shining reviews.
Wont shop anywhere else because there is no need.
Only a couple of standards, Guiness and Strongbow.
The bands were amazing but the bar just sucked.
, so I'd come back for the good vibes, bands, and beers, but no more burritos for me.
However, the space they do use has a pretty good selection.
Its huge, its the biggest brew structure to hit Toronto and
Not sure if it's really a place I'd frequent on the regular, but it's a nice spot to go to.
Food was good, about what you'd expect in that type of establishment.
Only four house brews were available, and my waiter didn't know what an IPA was, so
This pub is located in party central for Atlanta, the Buckhead district.
Stopped in here on my recent Southern California trip.
Felt like everyone was local, even though they probably weren't.
the vibe of the location is great - right on the canal in the business district in Ghent-
Parking was very tight with a SMALL parking lot behind the brewery.
The southbay is definitely one of my favorite areas to grab a beer and strangely enough, this just adds to the numerous craft breweries and bars in the area.
the space is fun, arty and open, with a cool front room with some natural light and a little more intimacy.
I doubt much has changed in the place since the mid 1800s.
Prices were reasonable, middle of the road.
One or two guest ales are offered at all times and have included Caledonian, Bateman's, Brakespeare, Marston's, Oakam, and Wells.
There is no food but they have a symbiotic relationship with a local taco tuck.
On an August 2018 visit they had 12 beers on tap, with some of these and some additional brews available in cans or bottles.
This is a very nondescript place in the Brookside neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri.
Being from the Midwest made this a real treat.
They add new seasonal beers every once in a while, and the Dreadnought is superb.
Staff is attentive, given the number of people being served.
Best brewery in the Twin Cities, hands down.
BBA beers, and iiipa's are in stock and plentiful for me.
The bartenders are generous when it comes to free samples, so you can try before you buy.
I also had some hot wings, chips and salsa, and some some of my chum's chicken nachos.
Super nice and large space that when busy is really busy!
I just started home brewing about a month ago and bought all my equipment from AHS.
The walls are adorned with beer pictures and the interior fixtures are all hand made from a guy that lives across the street.
The vibe is quite relaxed and a nice place to have an after work beer.
Definitely worth seeking out if you're in town.
Vibe: I stopped here for brunch on a Saturday (the only day they're open for breakfast)
not a mecca for beer geeks, but definitely a spot that would make a beer geek much happier than 99% of the other bars in the neighborhood.
It is an outstanding old tavern that has stood for well over a century.
Food was only pretzels and onion rings and small stuff like that.
The place now has a considerable number of flat screen TV's for those who want to watch a sporting event with their pint.
Venture too far away, though, and you may not feel so comfortable, especially if you are completely unfamiliar with the area.
Maybe enter wearing Canadian icons if you're from N.America
Not too far from the stadiums, so if you're going to a game, you can find much cheaper parking down that way.
You will also lose quality of service very fast as the bartenders become overly busy and often become visually flustered.
(I took the No. 63 Bus from the Ossington Street subway station - it passes right by.)
They also had some outdoor patio seating.
Been here many times for lunch or happy hour.
Every beer is in coolers with a great selection of harder to find beer.
Hard to enter as it is near a hotel but no big deal.
I was quickly greeted by several people, one of which I believe was the owner, she showed me around and explained the growler/bomber deal.
The (fairly new) outdoor beer garden space is one of the best places in Charlotte to enjoy a sunny day.
While driving into town, this and the Thirsty Monk were the first two places we came to.
I will start by addressing the one negative I've experienced at Maui Brewing Waikiki.
The draft list is displayed by a chalk board on the wall, and appeared to be keep up to date.
Employees are pretty chill sometimes I'll stay just chatting it up about new products and such.
Gets crowded after work, calms down around 7, weekends are busy.
I would suggest this place for the grilled cheese way before I would recommend it for the beer
When we walked in, only the pub area was available, and we sat ourselves.
They are mainly Old Dominion Brewing, Magic hat, Sam Adams ect.
I think at night they have DJs, but I have never witnessed this.
Although I had actual stones in my dish, twice, the food was great!
Bartenders are knowledgeable on their products and happy to offer samples.
Great German beers on tap such as Weinstephaner, Optimator, Franiskaner Dunklweiss, etc.
A great bottle shop run by freindly, knowledgable beer lovers.
The sides (like jalapeno tots) are really good too.
It is a very small bar, literally a hole in the wall.
Food is an increasingly interesting selection of cheeses, crackers and cured meats.
I went on a Friday night and it was fairly crowded.
The beer brewed here would be competitive anywhere, with a nice west coast hop feel similar to what you might find at one of the better SD breweries.
Selection is insane, but if there is something you don't see, just ask.
Hoax Brewing is part of the Beeracks Collaborative, East Haven , CT
Server,who we called Sven, was very quick and prompt.
Not sure how this place gets a bad rep for their bartenders.
since I really did like the set up and greatly enjoy mixing two of my top pleasures
They have a self service food area and various eateries offering pizza, sandwiches, ice cream, bar-b-que, etc.
This is probably because it was Game 3 of the NBA Finals.
The overall atmosphere however has not changed - mostly the neighborhood surrounding it has changed.
Odell is upbeat with outdoor music and event options there are spaces that invite beer snobbing and outdoor patio for a more upbeat atmosphere
Not exaclty close to downtown Fort Worth, but certainly within walking distance.
Not a shock it's a McMenamins establishment.
After the coffee bender I grabbed a bowl of the tomato basil, which came to 5 and change.
Lots and lots of hipsters around the place!
I did a sampler of beers and they were OK, but I really didn't find anything that pushed the envelope.
and he revealed that the have singles for sale at various prices.
Bar runs the legnth of the room and has an "old school" feeling.
He had a great selection but what really put it over the top was the labels on every beer that let you know when it came in or was brewed.
However, the price of the tasting was also...great!
they had a solid list of beers on tap, maybe a dozen or more to pick from, but i wasnt able to find a printed menu with any detail, so we just kind of randomly selected.
The atmosphere on this day was what made the experience, the liter beers didn't hurt.
The food is always spicy, which i love, but some may hate.
If you enjoy German brews, you will love Exile.
Most everything is wood paneled and old school.
Most comfortable spots when it is warm are 6 seats on sidewalk.
During our visit it was a rainy Saturday and there were few people in for lunch.
The staff was friendly, however, and seemed to enjoy talking with the kids who were in with families (and handed out balloons).
The waiting staff is more knowledgeable than any other place I've been.
My guess is review below is from competition or someone who has a bone to pick with place.
Visited Holstein's at the brand spanking new Cosmopolitan about two weeks after opening.
I had never been in to the tavern, but on a recent Saturday shopping expedition I wanted to check some football scores.
It is a small establishment with a whole lot of character.
The bar probably holds 12-15 and there are scattered high top tables throughout.
Awesome atmosphere, very spacious and shaded outside seating area with a covered pavilion to grab a bite at.
In addition to serving an amazing selection off coffee and imported tea products and other coffeehouse type fare, they have a few taps.
They also have great events that are open for anyone to join in, which is nice since many stores in the area tend to exclude people who just by a little at a time.
that's when you discover it's not your average liquor store anymore.
On the way to NE for work, had a layover both ways and took some notes.
The bar has two levels as well as plenty of outside seating.
Overall I had a very enjoyable time here and plan to go again.
Puppets, a very high ceiling (formerly a Gallows house!).
there was enough smoke to be noticeable but not overly offensive.
I actually lived right across the street from this store years ago, but only first visited about two weeks ago.
Are there better beer bars in RI - sure, but E&O has a little somethin', somethin' in my opinion.
10 beers on offer, 5 standards an 5 rotating.
Reviewed from notes taken during a visit to Atlanta for meetings about a year ago.
A u turn after passing it I made it to the restaurant.
The ambiance here is more applicable for a nice restaurant than it is for a brewpub.
The prices were reasonable, and I will be going back to visit this little gem!
Located in the Power Plant Live area of the Inner Harbor
The selection of beers was quite impressive, and the service was quite cordial.
It's also connected to the best beer store in the city, Beertopia.
They are also willing to tell you some of the grains that go into the beers they have on tap.
Since this was the opening night, the bottle list was not yet complete, but there still were around 400 bottles available.
Having said that, the people were friendly when they dealt with us.
I can't ever seem to pass up the $10 beer flights with a choice of ANY beer on the menu.
For Raleigh, NC this is a must stop for good beer.
I think they had 15 beers on tap that night, most were average at best.
Their selection is the best in Nashville, IMO- nice local finds, all kinds of beers distributed in the region, some imports, and they also get rare releases.
Went here one day when the fest was too crowded.
Rather impressed on my visit when through town on business.
Atmosphere - With an outdoor patio now open this place gets a new added feature it was missing before.
I ended up picking up a bottle of Talisker 18 year for a very affordable price, and none of the Binny's in Chicago had it in stock.
As others have stated this place is not your average beer bar.
If you like beer and you're in Rochester, this is the place to go.
I really enjoyed this place and would recommend it to anyone in KC.
The restaurant is small yet has a great atmosphere, not really family friendly, I have yet to see anyone under 21.
I went on a Saturday afternoon and will never be back again.
I tried the helles lager, and thought it was fantastic.
They have a good sense of conversation and letting you know what has arrived and what beer is selling quickly so you can get your hands on some.
Refreshing to find a cask option in a taproom and the environment is perfect to me:
While the draft selection is somewhat limited, what they do offer is plenty of local breweries, a few unknown to me.
The service is good, and generally what I expect.
They also offer some craft brew from America if that is what you're looking for - Dogfish Head and Breckenridge.
At least fourtenn taps on, the majority being craft choices including a feature craft.
Clientele is diverse, ranging from college students and macro fans to craft beer enthusiasts depending on the special of the night.
it's not the biggest craft store in the cities, but I feel it's definitely one of the best.
the space is rad too, high ceilings in an old warehouse looking industrial space, but the christmas lights draped over the pile of barrels and
Just like most Mellow Mushrooms I've been to the one
The inside has a few picnic tables and a "standing" bar.
Dropped in on a Thursday night with some friends.
Vibe seemed nice though it was early in the afternoon.
Well this is about the only game in town if your looking for a decent selection of brews.
Didn't eat but their menu looked pretty tasty.
Craft Brewed is separated into a high gravity (over 6% ABV) and low gravity (under 6% ABV) section, which is common practice due to Tennessee's wonky alcohol laws.
so does my wife, so this is a good place where we can go and have good food and some interesting beer.
Small bar but a surprisingly good selection.
Service was not stellar, and yes I was there for a Monday wing night, which was part of the problem!
Even got an impromptu tour of the brewhouse.
Only a few people in the place when we got there.
This place has been open almost 4 years, and has developed a GREAT group of "regulars" that hold down the fort through an ever-changing crew of patrons.
Sleepy Dog's a BYOF -- the only food they serve is popcorn and peanuts.
Overall, would not buy any of their beers in a store, but the location was so good that it overshadowed the beer.
Plenty of TV's hanging around providing the typical sports scores and updates.
I like pasties and they had lotsa good combinations.
2015: A diamond in the rough, though attention to detail is a little lacking.
so now I go there all the time for after work drinks.
You have to really look when you are browsing as it is easy to miss something, especially on the top shelves.
so there's no pile of leftovers that never get used.
One bonus, however, is that they know how to do sweet potato fries right.
There are a lot of high end restaurants nearby as well if you're a food enthusiast.
but I think they were the only ones I couldn't get in Colorado as far as bombers go.
As we went through them, one thing which struck me and is different than most flights I've had is ...
It is more expensive but I feel that you get your money's worth
This place has the best beer and most of all the best security!
Small beer cooler with tons of beers stashed in there.
I would have fought to go the day before and spend the entire day there.
My brother told me about this place and took me here while I was on a trip to Orlando.
One of the first "must try" pubs on my list &
For the small amount of shelf space they have a great selection of bombers stocked.
The original brewery for Upslope is still up and running.
I don't do a whole lot of reviewing on BA
Their 40 taps are well-chosen with a nice variety of breweries and styles, and the quality of choice is also high.
Overall, had an enjoyable afternoon trying a variety of beer.
Beautiful summer day in Philly, breezy and relaxed.

They Usually have about 4 of their beers on tap, one root beer and bottles of Peroni.
But it's not an overly excellent place when others like The Answer in town.
Cool lighting and seating - ol' fashion bar aesthetic.
The wall of beer listings is made up of big stick-on squares that are very informative and easy to read.
Dog-friendly, and while there isn't any hot food available
I had to leave to visit another bar, but after a beer there, I just couldn't believe I had left such a high quality place in Olbaren
The terrace is the spot to be whenever it's a nice day out.
I visited after work on a weeknight and the place was pretty mellow (except for the muted 90s heavy metal).
Prices were very reasonable, and I am actually looking forward to getting back to the Thirsty Pig soon.
It almost feels like you are stepping back in time when you enter this place.
this place has a decent tap seltion, maybe 12 or so
The brick paved streets are very nostalgic to St Louis as is the view of the Arch from almost anywhere in the downtown area.
NC breweries are well represented with selections from Foothills, Natty Greene's, Duck Rabbit and Highland.
The food that showed up at the next table looked pretty good.
An American craft beer bar that has a sleek, wood-accented bar and a relaxed atmosphere.
They will sell you singles of most beers too.
Came here after deciding to not fight my way in at Other Half.
w/ a giant window in front that really lets the light in.
First things first: the employees are absolutely clueless.
The service was great, bartender willing to chat and help me plan out my Brooklyn beer stops.
This bar had very few patrons the night we visited even considering
Collins, which probably explains why no one has heard of it, but if you find yourself in the southern part of town
Came here one afternoon while visiting Dallas.
Would get a much higher atmosphere if not for that.
Concrete floors and bar, the aesthetics were a little too minimal for me personally, but it's definitely a nice place.
The service is severely lacking and outright weird.
oz. samples of House Beer, Dubbel, Fluxus 2016, and Interlude on my visit.
Beautiful woman work there, honestly might be a prerequisite to land a job as a waitress.
A handful of tables and barrel "tables" around the rest of the space.
One of the best (and newer) restaurants in town.
This will kick up some dust in the future.
So I had gotten off the tram station at Bourse, and was walking to the Place Hotel to go check it out.
I stop her to get brands I cannot get in Alabama.
Hops & Hominy is located near Union Square tucked away between buildings.
They have Crooked Stave and Cantillion bottles regularly.
Visited with my wife on a recent trip to San Diego and Los Angeles.
Stopped here this past February, before the rush of SF beer week.
This place is located just a few minutes north of Burlington in Winooski, VT, whose greatest beer attraction is the quality bottle shop in town.
However, all day Tuesday pints are $3 which can't be beat and my main excuse to go.
Selection itself is decent (the Total Wine in next shopping center is probably better)
I had the chance to visit this place a couple of weeks ago.
I like the Wickenden Street Pub for many reasons.
Enjoyable finish to a day that began with several hours at the Biere de le Mondiale festival.
This place is in an impressive looking building with a very modern, urban feel applied to the typical stone and metal look of a wood-fired pizza joint.
My biggest problem is that it is way too expensive.
I would not hesitate to stop in again if I were looking for a good dinner with a decent beer selection.
The beers were very mediocre, and had a chalky mouthfeel.
I met my brother there after work yesterday, a Friday, to have a few beers.
You can buy a 6 pack from the cases and they'll keep the bottles in the cooler until you need them.
a li'l badass young jazz trio freestylin' some jams.
That being said, they have a surprisingly good craft beer selection with 5 taps for 32 and 64 oz growler fills.
They had a ton of good beer options on tap, different breweries and different styles, with the day’s specials on a chalk board above the wall-o-taps.
It seems as though this King St area is becoming somewhat of a beer mecca for JAX.
Definitely worth going to if you live nearby or are visiting.
The prices are pretty reasonable and they seem to score some pretty rare brews.
The food as one might expect by the name is pub fare.
Was only there three nights (Sunday through Tuesday) but went back for a 2nd time and was equally pleased.
What I had: Buxton Black Rocks, Sly Fox Pikeland Pilsner, and Freigeist Abraxxxas on tap, Hickory Smoked Pulled Pork plate with collard greens and coleslaw for me,
They seemed to go through a period of lackluster service a while back.
Definitely go when you have some time to kill cause you'll be here a while.
I would have preferred to wait out the storm at Le Saint Bock with better beer.
As soon as you walk in you see this is a different kind of bar.
The service was very slow even though the crowd was thin.
It's nice that they have a separate parking lot, considering their location on the west side of downtown.
Their Triple is outstanding for the price.
You can only order two small pours at a time.
Good gawd people, do a BETTER job of cleaning the chemicals out of your glasses!!!
Singles can be purchased and consumed at the bar.
Their beer selection is right up there with the best in the city--Discount Liquor stands out as one of the few places head and shoulders above it for variety.
Nice little brewery tucked away in an industrial park.
A dozen house beers on tap and 4 or 5 guest taps.
If you're in the mood to have beers over dinner, the atmosphere is fantastic...
There's both a bar on the main floor as well as upstairs.
maybe I was just here on an off day?), and just a couple of tables (some with chairs, some without).
The people were very friendly and informative, and the beer was excellent.
I sampled a few brews before settling on their chocolate milk stout, which was great.
Very classy old school type liquor store.
The second Saucer i had ever been to outside my home Saucer in Houston.
I also believe there's more room to quaff/dine to the far back/right of the Pub.
Cool atmosphere with great local artists' work around the walls.
Pricing seemed a bit higher than I'm used to, but could be a Portland thing.
There is a little bit of "old brewhouse funk" lingering in the air, and though you get used to it, it isn't entirely pleasant.
I had an Austin Beerworks Black Thunder, which was a perfect match for my bratwurst & sauerkraut, both made on the premise, along with the mustard.
It has exposed brick walls and high ceilings that create a real sense of open space.
There is also a patio located on the left side of the bar.
Definitely leaning toward the industrial (open space, high ceiling) / hipster type vibe.
Their beer list is always extensive and includes some of the best from all over the place.
The manager, (done gone and forget his name again like the fool I am) and the rest of the staff are super friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly.
some are great, quite a few others are mediocre.
Walked in and was able to find the bar after walking around trying to find the bathroom which happened to be upstairs.
I walked around with no one in site, but I could hear a couple guys talking about the beer they were brewing behind a partition.
I stopped here on a recent trip to orlando.
There are several tables and an area with a number a couches and comfy chairs.
Location is a slight bit south of the tourist area of old town.
Beers are priced in tiers (1-4) and, honestly, I am always hesitant to buy anything beyond Tier 1.
I'm not sure if this is the same place as the one I visited on Rue Beaubien E.
It is a dance hall style bar that is dark and dingy.
Have seen at least 2 new one in as many weeks.
Visited 8 craft breweries in the Denver area and this was my favorite.
Both the beer and the food were reasonably priced and the service was friendly and prompt.
The waitstaff has always been friendly and knowledgeable, the food is really good and the beer is pretty good too.
Stopped in recently while on a biz trip in ABQ for the day.
Located in the "historic" section of Ellicott City this bar looks diveish on the outside, but once you see the tap-list you will be happy you came in.
Great place to stop to get a very nice selection of craft beer.
The stools were going to be removed to prepare for "the crowd".
Visited the new store a week or so ago on a trip down to Melbourne.
It's the fact that some import and special bottles are priced way over what they should be.
Tasty lentil soup, hearty turkey or lobster pot pie, a delicious braised rabbit, and a fine hot cobbler for dessert.
The hot wings we ordered were large and meaty but average on taste with the basic Durkee's Red Hot sauce as a coating.
I went back to my table, chatted about beer, and the waitress came back with my beer and to take the rest of the table's order.
The last three times I have been I have left empty handed.
Entrance is in back, there is a ton of parking even though it was packed on Saturday night.
Food is good especially the Fish Sandwich.
The waitress was great and very knowledgeable about the beers, but the hostess on ourway in was a definite downer.
Twenty or so tap list with emphasis on new Maine craft and Belgian and Germans mixed in.
When I first went I really enjoyed the beer and had great vibes.
Visited Meadows on 2/28/12 for the first time, after working so close for over 3 years to this establishment.
These guys really know their stuff and it shows in their consistently good, balanced offerings.
The Sharp Edge Bistro is the closest beer bar to where I live, so I visit there fairly often.
Also had Chiswick Ale, the IPA, and the ESB.
He was merrily drinking an Imperial Stout.
The friendly staff were happy to answer my questions on a mildly busy night.
They have a decent list of bottle beers that start at 3.95 and go up to 5.95, but its a list of what the ABC liquor store sells next door just at higher prices.
they really need acoustic treatments on the ceilings.
The staff was pretty knowledgeable and were able to answer any questions I had.
Ive been here a few times and they have great service and a great selection.
But, on the upside, the way upside, more quality offerings and a much bigger selection.
Good beer selection, but not much more than you can find at your local beer store.
The beer goddesses know most of us by name and take good care of us.
Upon investigation, the barstaff didnt really know what was going on with the beers.
Service was pretty attentive and the prices were reasonable with each of our party of 10 spending about 22-25 euro each for dinner plus 3 brews over about 3-3.5 hours.
This place is small and the bar is small, just a few stools.
Food is alright for the money, standard menu of burgers and such.
A really nice selection that always seems to be getting larger.
The place is seated in the heart of Willimantic, close to ECSU and UConn, located inside of a retired post office building.
Small service bar and many communal picnic tables.
We had a fantastic time and loved all of the outdoor space!
It is mostly table service with little, if any bar space.
We did buy some snacks and had some of the free popcorn to go along with the beers.
The only recommendations I'd give the owners would be to list the beers on the wall so the patrons can see, with ease, the beers available.
Loved this place...lowkey, laid back vibe and the bartender was nice and new her stuff.
Although Granite City is a fun place to hang out, they actually don't have too much on tap here
The styles included a pilsner, dark strong, witbier, altbier, brown ale, Scottish ale, American pale ale, Belgian pale ale, dunkelweizen, IPA, porter, and imperial stout.
P FL is my co-favorite store in the city, along with Beer Temple.
Great staff who was extremely informative on their beers.
Even Sea Hag – by far their most widely distributed and accessible beer – is one of the best in class.
Food trucks available if in need of something to munch on.
like anyone can throw a place together and own a bar nowaday.
I like the new place much more than I remember liking their old location.
I can’t say enough great things about this place.
hard to beat hanging out here when the weather isnt too hot.
this is a really good barbeque joint right off the red line.
However, once found, the interior was clean, modern and inviting with a beautiful stainless steel brewing setup in the background.
Went here about a week ago, like the over all feel of the place, went for lunch
UPDATE TO PREVIOUS REVIEW: They have a new draft system and now offer growler fills.
Finally got to check this place out with YouBrewIDrink on our way to the NotF 2010.
wait staff is definitely there to push the $40 prime rib....
The selection is great and the prices aren't off the charts.
The restaurant itself is small and decorated quite simply with lots of wood and earthy colors.
Where the hell is the bar once you enter the door?
Don't overlook this place on a Cincinnati trip.
Once inside, you might think you're in some crappy convenience store...
When you walk to the bathrooms, you first go past the barrel room, and it truly becomes apparent just how serious these guys are...
so they always a great selection of their own
i was amazed at the beer list, they had to have nearly 20 beers flowing, and i didnt drink one in here that i didnt like.
They make solid but standard beers, simple and accessible.
Troegs, Victory, Long Trail, Penn, Lancaster, Erie, Sierra Nevada, Great Lakes, Dogfishead, just to name a few.
It looked very crowded from outside, but they were able to seat my large party immediately with no fuss.
Don't hesitate to go there and spend the day exploring.
I mean how great of customer service is that.
it was kinda like going to Applebes for dinner but with better food and beer for the same price.
Service was pretty good and NOT annoying compared to a lot of other restaurants.
Was there during the early afternoon on a weekday.
It's the brewery, and you've got a pretty typical brewery experience.
Visited Beveridge Place Pub in West Seattle and was pleasantly surprised.
The Center City Foodery is a very small convenience store lined with beer refrigerators.
Very nice tasting barleywine, better than I expected.
Much better than the limited offerings at typical airport bars, or the lame Rock Bottom in the 'C' terminal.
Overall, really cool place to grab a beer.
I was disappointed that they were out of stock on so many different beers.
I just drank the NEIPAs but they had a good selection of beer types on tap.
Blackfriar station is right outside and Blackfriar bridge is a short walk.
It is long and narrow, with a medium size bar on one side and tables spaced comfortably throughout the rest of the room.
Went here on a Saturday night with a large group ( 12 people ) they told us about an hour wait, as we'd probably expected.
Following them on instagram s the best way to see new fun brews in house @baccoswineandcheese.
Would recommend this place if you are in the area.
First time at the brew pub even though I've wanted to come for a long time.
all specialty beer, all fresh, all served in proper glassware, at the proper temperature, with great care.
Wide selection of beers covering many styles.
It's very casual and you can bring your dog.
Catering to those in the restaurant "industry".
It still warrants a trip or stop though if you're in passing.
The place was pretty busy when i was there.
To the left along the outer wall were shelves of National Geographic magazines.
Not that great unless you like that sort of thing or are intoxicated.
Huge pallets along the wall as I came in held fresh cans available for sale.
Many tables and benches - like how I would imagine a rural Czech beer hall in West Virginia.
Small at home location with big time all are welcome feeling.
I was also happy to know that when I called, the chef himself was answering the phone etc.
Stopped here while walking through the Cosmopolitan.
I dont often go here, but I just visited again this weekend.
they did have a big selection when i was in though, and im sure they are making better beers than the ones i had, as the place was absolutely packed on a weeknight
I'm sure the flies on the walls have many stories to tell.
This is a must if you are in San Francisco.
Found out this was only a five minute drive from school.
Got to spend a good amount of time on a slower day to chat.
People, if you spend even one hour of your visit to Montreal in this bar you're doing yourself a major disservice.
Once you are done you can go down a few doors to Carytown Wine and Beer.
Well I pull into Hamilton's , and find maybe the darkest bar around.
OK, I'm going to be clear that I'm giving this place a few more tries before I completely dismiss it.
, I had the Golden Hour Orange IPA, it was very nice.
I have been here a couple of times on trips to DC and enjoyed my visits each time.
The German Purity law makes it challenging to have beer that stands out.
The food is pretty solid, haven't had a bad meal yet.
Prices are a touch higher then some other stores in the Portland area
Exceptional location on a quiet mews, off the beaten path and one would never know it was there unless you stumbled upon it.
They had coolers of bombers and six-packs.
I arrived right at opening on a saturday.
It's never about dumping hops into a bottle.
They only serviced Irish brews and liquors.
so if you prefer a non-smoking environment hit in the summer/fall or early in the evening.
Stop in for a drink after seeing reviews on beeradvocate.
Overshores was the original tenet in what has become the Connecticut Beer Collective.
This store's drive up makes you think of any other run of the mill beer store.
The beer selection is awful for a Beerfly site.
when there is a big game on, they play the audio through the main speaker system, so this is a really great place to watch the game.
Mikkeller Bar is a stark contrast from the Tenderloin neighborhood of which it sits on the border.
Its about 6 blocks from my place, which is a nice walk on any evening.
My only other caveat is that you check the "Best By" date on any selection, as stock sometimes sits for years.
There are 3 TVs and the management seems to want to go in a sports bar (i.e., Saints and LSU) theme direction.
Because it is so small, sitting options are limited when trying to settle down and concentrate on their great beers.
Service was friendly, efficient and informative.
It's a modest but well-curated selection and a welcome relief from the Playwright and its twin brother on East Broadway.
We stopped here on a Monday afternoon to enjoy their beers and to have dinner.
The other half is solid local and regional options.
Almost 10 years ago I walked into Brawley's the day that NC popped the cap on the (at one time)
5 beers on tap with a "mystery tap" that rotates product (currently serving Hoegaarden white ale).
Visit Midnight Sun and have some great beer and food.
Great assortment, interior is true to it's original heritage.
Hard to discuss value when the U.S. Dollar is at an all time low...
Will definetly come back if i find myself wandering around duping circle in need of some zza.
And other beers came out in other brewery glasses.
Located at 11th & Fitzwater, not too far from South Street.
Very cool campus setting on the north side of town.
I must say this is fastly becoming my new favorite spot to go after work.
Well it was an interesting place at best, big open area, some barrels strewn about, big wooden beams with hard carved totem things.
It’s a big store with about 3 aisles being dedicated to craft beer.
The chalk board is what every good beer bar does but is not placed very well in the old Union House proably because of the great bar that's been around for a while.
We sat at a large table with bench style seating.
The selection at this place is incredible, even better when you're looking to trade rather than buying.
They definitely fill growlers (German style).
I tried finding a cooler with some to-go cans but if there was one, I missed it.
They do rotate the taps pretty often, so the mix of offerings does seem to be different each time I visit.
Had the pretzel app (excellent) and turkey sandwich on a pretzel roll (very good).
I had a $16 London Broil dinner, big portion size, cooked to order (medium), tender and tasty.
the beer list was extremely ambitious for a new brewery, i really enjoyed the imperial oaked wit and the quad.
I feel very lucky to work so close to this gem.
The place is close to Denver's Central Business District and its always crowded with a mostly younger crowd.
The prices are very competitive and if you can manage to slow Danny down for a few minutes he's always good for geeking out on some beer talk.
While many of there beers are hard to find, the range in selection accommodates everyone from the casual to the extreme beer drinkers.
This place has an excellent selection for a grocery store.
To this date, it has to be one of my favorite selections of singles (domestic and international).
For me one of the two places you simply must drink Youngs Bitter if you are ever in London (other-see Morpeth Arms).
At the listed address is a Mexican joint and different offices.
Nothing better than drinking a great beer and playing bocce!
If you're looking for glassware, they've got a nice selection for sale.
I look forward to going there and every time I do I am reminded of how fantastic it is.
One thing I will say for them - their house barbecue sauce might be the best I have ever tasted.
They have a nice outdoor space in front and offer free valet parking.
The comeback is a place rich with character, the kind of bar that we dont have enough of these days.
the Manayunk section of Philly has this still in the hills off of cosmo/Jetta pottery barn main street.
Total of fivetables and four barstools crammed in here.
I picked up a 2008 Rio Reserva and a Cuvee Delphine.
The tap list is nice for a brewpub, they had some casks at the bar that were not publicized at all, you just had to know about them.
They list them above the front entrance, with the brew date, the % alcohol content, and a description.
Visited on Election Day/Night, so there was a good crowd and a good buzz to the place.
I didn't know there were great beer bars like this around Ditmars.
The food is really good- lots of fresh ingredients, unusual recipes, good flavor.
The Lange Wapper had my number that night.
Is it true that your expectations have a high impact on your final impressions?
And the building could really be a great place!!!
The interior is really nice and somewhat chaotic, but what really made it nice was the woodstove behind us.
for sides I had the blue cheese grits and vanilla yams....
People say they have the biggest beer selection in town
Other taps included Walt Wit, Port Older Viscosity, Maduro Brown, Lagunitas IPA and others I can't recall.
I was in this brewpub 5 years ago on a tour of the ruins of Detroit.
From the outside, it looks like a small neighborhood market, catering to the surrounding residenial area.
The Brewer makes great use of what is available, with a constantly changing variety of unusual beers, from simple, to sour, to hi octane.
I usually go and have had a third of the 84 beers that are on tap.
If you are looking for unique one off beers go to the tap room, not the restaurant.
The small events they have here are always a blast.
Service in the store was fine, although I didn't see anyone in the aisles to answer questions.
A place I will frequent again and again...
Otter Creek Hop Session Ale, Dogfish Head Sixty-One,
that’s more our fault for going to KC in July.
The crowd is mixed with locals, people stopping by after work and people there for the beer.
Pretty slow at the bar as you would expect.
Located in the Westport area this beer bar / gastropub is owned by the same owners as all the rest of the places in that intersction.
The one positive is the beers were only 2 bucks.
Luckily they have a beer garden out back for plebeians like myself.
it's a sports bar with a very good beer selection.
I thought the selection was somewhat limited, as it seemed they had other seasonal beers that I would have liked to try.
Sounds more like a 'fun' bar than a beer bar, but there are 20 taps that include local beers, Goose Island, Great Lakes, Dogfish, Victory, etc.
Generally, their taps are pretty good, no swill beer taking up room.
Probably wouldn't go back, but glad I stopped to check it out.
Besides the main bar, on the lower level there is an upstairs bar(from what I gather rarely open, unless its really busy) with a few pool tables in it.
They have a huge selection of many different types of beers to my surprise.
Each visit was mid-day, nothing much going on except for good friends visiting over good beer.
Having relatives in the area, I looked forward to visiting Ladyface on a recent trip.
The server was also the bartender which was pretty odd.
I've been three times now, and this place is consistently very good.
So the remodel they did went well - for a mini mart this place is very nice!
The draw is about 20 brews on tap, but the current poor service sends us elsewhere.
The best part is that he owns a regular convenience store across the street.
KC Bier Co has a real German beer hall vibe.
If you like to enjoy a nice craft beer and perhaps a pint of something new then I would recommend Bottlescrew.
Great beer selection at very reasonable prices.
I've been enjoying the beers from Switchback for a while as I've been visiting Vermont fairly often over the past few years.
Once you do find it, you'll see that it's totally worth the visit.
The outside patio was more busy than the inside.
Servers run from knowledgable to clueless as you would expect.
these guys have been around awhile though, making some really solid beers.
After an unsuccessful attempt to enjoy some Westvleteren beers at the abbey (it was closed), we decided to check out Brugge on the way back..
Their only "belgian" beer is stella which sorry, in my opinion, is not very "belgianesque" at all.
Not what you’d expect, however much more if you like a cool hole in the wall place.
Service is fast, courteous and knowledgeable, perhaps more toward the food than the beer, but knowledgeable nonetheless.
Cool place, i’ve been meaning to get here for years
The beer menu on the wall was detailed regading what kind of glassware you would receive the beer in and the price for each size and each beer.
Nice open atmosphere in an industrial complex, but still plenty of room with tables and a bar.
The vibe at both locations I've been to (Gold & Wyoming) is kinda meh.
I'll have to be honest, however, I didn't drink any beer while I was there, since I was on lunch break from work.
There's no table service, but the bartenders were attentive.
Overall I had an excellent time there eating with some friends from boston and enjoyed a couple good brews.
I really appreciated that they served half pints on a majority of their beers, which allowed me to try many more beers.
Visited a few Sunday's ago for the La Roja GR release.
longer bar, busy in mid-aft offseason weekday.
I had the wild mushrooms in truffle oil, the alligator, and the cheese plate.
Trips throughout the US in the 90’s and, (as an Englishman), many trips to London have consistently proved that the two don’t always go hand in hand.
If this was to be listed more of a beer bar and less of a gourmet, wood fired, pizza, this place would rank highly among beer bars in the country.
Located just across I25 from downtown this restaurant is on the edge of the Highland’s area.
The store/brewpub is located on a busy commercial street.
What looks like a pretty straightforward steak house joint, manages to give a similar experience in the beer department as well.
(right now the Yeti is an example of this).
You're not just paying for products here, you are paying for experience and knowledge.
I'll start out this review by asking this question: Why do craft beer pubs in SF all need to be divey and seedy, with obnoxious music (Toronado) and disgusting washrooms?
This building was the former home of Olde Mecklenburg Brewing.
Its easy to find what you want and if you can't there are plenty of staff available to help you out.
Let's you try a full range for just a couple bucks.
Most of the bottles off this list are pretty expensive (usually around a 100-150% markup), but some of them are pretty reasonable for the vintage/rarity.
Bartender was knowledgeable and the taps were very clean.
They had about 7 of their own brews, but we're out of what looked like the two best ones.
Food is tasty and a little different than standard pub fare.
Though this brewer has been held up as an example of what is best in the NV craft-brew scene, I wasn't much impressed with their location.
If you're visiting Chicago you won't regret a quick train/bus/Uber ride south to 31st to visit.
That was another great beer although it had a great hop flavour and perfect straw colour
All manner of breweriana decorate the walls, including an impressive collection of beer cans and Hamms signs.
Not too crowded, which I loved though the owners may not.
had a few beers and dinner here early on a Saturday evening, prior to a concert at Union Transfer a few blocks away.
Lots of rooms, lots of patios, and multiple stories.
It was true to form and one of the more impressive domestic hefeweizens I have enjoyed.
It was honestly the best time I had that day.
Went to an Expedition Stout vertical for four years which I thought was reasonably priced for generous pours.
and I had just crossed into canada after quit the ordeal with immigration, and hit 17th st.
My numeric rating is notation all indicicative of my actual rating.
However, the guy working did manage to get me a sample or two which was nice.
He had a belgian dark ale, a belgian blonde, a double IPA, two other IPAs, a porter, as well as some others.
Let me explain exactly what this place is:
The buffalo burger went over reasonably well, and the fries were fresh cut ocean style.
They add tax to the price on the board unlike most breweries, so a pint ends up costing
Before coming, all I knew of OMB was the six packs I have seen at Total Wine in Greensboro.
Highly recommend for good beer good food for a casual night out!
and we're well behaved but a lot of restaurants get mad at a huge group of guys showing up.
My favorites were Woke and Rainbow Sherbet.
The prices at this store rival anyone in the area.
i think all their beer is solid too, some more ambitious than others, but they are always fresh and professionally executed, and the food is dope as well.
Many different Cigar city beers that most other stores did not have like their papaya IPA.
My pint was excellent (Hereford's Bitter).
This pub specializes in made from scratch appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches and pasta.
They usually run specials a couple days a week on beers and wings, all u can eat type stuff.
This place was a nice welcome to Chicago.
The staff is more or less attentive, but nothing special.
Had some nice pale ales and IPAs while partaking of a grilled cheese with bacon in it.
We walked inside and the place was empty but a few guys were working.
Probably, there aren't a whole lot of places in the immediate area and it would be a good place for a beer and, maybe, a bite.
Interesting tap room on the 2nd floor of a massive warehouse.
looked like lots of locals gambling or drinking away their paycheck.
Visited the tap room on a Sunday afternoon during a Saints game.
GREAT to have this neat little pub so close to home in the nicely renovated Worthington Mall.
Over crowded, and under-educated (regarding their server's knowledge of beer).
There is a second bar area on the left, that was not open at this time, but gives them room to spread out during peak hours.
Also happy to see that they weren't destroying my wallet.
the place was popping on a sunday afternoon, and the beers were flowing.
I did not try the food in this place, but after taking a peek at the menu
some of the best burgers in St. Louis, seasonal sandwiches and salads, tacos, wraps, and creative sides.
If you're using Maps to find it, have faith and stop when it tells you to and drive around back.
The beer list was extremely extensive and it will take you awhile just to read all the beers this place has to offer.
they do not give tours, but you can see from inside behind on of the main rooms thru the glass wall....
Also represented are taps from Tennants, Bells, Uplands and the usual Brit pub fare (Guinness, Bass, etc).
Decent beer, especially for a place that started in a business park.
As far as beer goes, the year-round selections are ok, but the rotating seasonals they put out are fantastic!
The rear dinning area seems approriately sized and the exposed kitchen is right behind.
That's a pretty damn good ratio for anyone, much less a relatively small shop that is more than 50% dedicated to wine.
Handy place in Antwerp that is literally within staggering distance of the beautiful cathedral.
At the time there were probably 6 or 7 seasonal's on tap as well as their normal selection.
We got there and the bartender said they did not carry all their beers up here
It's a fairly low-key store front with a small logo present.
The selection is the most diverse that I have encountered in the area.
With only 6 lines, there wasn't a whole lot of selection to choose from.
A few months ago, I moved back to the area full-time and thought being a 10-minute drive from the Beer Baron would be a blessing.
12-15 tables run through the L-shaped interior along with a foosball table.
Typical looking restaurant from the outside and upon entering.
If you live on the Kansas side of KC, go visit as Missouri seems to have easier liquor laws for beer distribution.
Of course the selection is purely locals, no imports or even macros let alone micros from outside the area, but I can't fault that too much.
Gets very loud even if there aren't a lot of people there.
and I am intent in trying Holeman & Finch
Lots of happy people and plenty of great beers flowing.
i was surprised to see like a dozen beers on tap, at least ten, and some pretty ambitious recipes too.
Great feel with many people sitting at tables enjoying the beer.
This is the place to go in Robinson for good beer and atmosphere.
Unfortunately the frat crowd is probably the biggest group that goes here, so that influences the type of beers they sell.
Overall its not as loud as the other pubs in town.
You will be able to find ALL of your veggies, meat, fruit, general kitchen needa.
it will range from deschutes to bruery to russian river to stone to lost abbey to goose island to belgium imports and much more.
There's some great shops, including a good bottle shop, within walking distance.
Lovely space for group meal and drinks, place to spend awhile that isn’t too loud or busy.
Guess I never got around to reviewing this place.
Along with their large indoor seating area, they also have a beer garden in the back and a patio in the front.
The beers I've had here were just mediocre.
A large collection of salt and pepper shakers.
And actually, one of the best times to go is Sunday morning for brunch.
During that time I had the chance to check out a LOT of shops from Long Beach to Pasadena, Hermosa to Glendora.
There isn't much near it that isn't industrial, so you have to be going there to go there.
The Service was a tad slow for my taste, they were not too busy
A large selection of Belgium beers from a bunch of breweries of only heard of and not yet seen.
You can really tell he's into what he does.
To say it is a Beer Mecca would be an understatement.
stopped in for some lunch and a beer before a bike ride.
and then they have their experimental recipes on display.
The guy who served us the beer did a nice thing and walked over to the people to diffuse the situation and we gladly got our seats back.
All the tables, chairs, and stools look like they were bought at Pier One though.
Ten bucks gets you a pint glass you can keep plus 6 tasting tickets.
Was disappointed with their West Coast IPA however which has a 75 IBU but did not have the hop profile I was expecting with a rating in that area.
They had a shelf full of The Abyss and no bottle limit from what I recall.
Unfortunately the selection was average for a Whole Foods, a few hundred beers but nothing crazy I couldn't find elsewhere.
You can tell that the clientele on a Sunday morning is much different than what you would expect on a weekend night.
The frozen pint glass needs to be worked on but all in all a great place for pizza and good beer.
allow lots of natural sunlight and weather to make its way through, and I can forsee this becoming a very popular spot for food trucks, live music, etc.
I even mentioned one to him that would be great to see on tap
They open at 1130, we arrived early but they let us in anyway.
that's usually full of your working class, except on weekends when the back room is packed with all types, not where i thought i'd sit down on sat.
The bock and the red were just not that great.
Fun Fact: I don't recall there being any mead.
Not an overly large space, but it is packed floor to ceiling, and organized very well too.
They have a mix-a-six which probably looks good to an out-of-stater, but I'll bet it's pretty lame to the locals.
On the Post Road in Orange it can get lost in the mix, seems a bit generic even though it is anything but that.
Bell Beverage has one of the best selections of craft beers and imports in SE PA, and their prices are very fair.
This place is a hole in the wall and not in a good way.
it's in a sort of industrial alley with a gravel parking lot.
I didn't eat, but my friends were raving about the pizza and salad they hammered through quite quickly.
starting to believe draft is the way to go).
Bengali Tiger and Southern Tier 2x I.P.A. will keep me happy while I'm there.
The other essential thing is that they have dedicated people that work at the beer counter.
and im not sure any other places in vegas received any.
Great beers, world class IPA's, not much to complain about.
A friend and I took their brewery tour which is $7 (I think) and includes 5 tastings.
Went there for the Pliny The Younger tapping.
At the time it was an excellent restaurant and I had a number of memorable meals there over the next few years.
Brewery had 9 of their own beers on tap, 6 year-round and 3 seasonal specials; the 6 I had were very nice.
The best day I think to go in on Wednesday.
Sometimes they have unfiltered brews and that's an added bonus.
Yes, the atmosphere of this place could be better.
Service has ranged from very good to poor.
but the bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable.
This used to be a regular north side of town hangout for me.
Located right on a river, Waterhuis has a great vantage point for taking in the sights of Ghent.
I stop by here once in a while, and I am always pleased.
Located in the old meat packing district in Chicago.
You don't go to Octoberfest in Munich for the food, so don't come here for the food.
And these guys, and especially Chris will gladly answer all your questions about how to brew beer.
I would highly recommend a first visit as I don't think you'll be disappointed.
We moved on to the bottling plant, and then a short film about the brewery.
They only serve one beer as they have since they first opened, but it is a delicious dark lager!
As far as I could tell, they brew, they serve, they clean glasses, they do it all; and they're super friendly while they're doing it.
Beers were tasty, the food was overpriced and underwhelming.
Definitely worth dropping in for the beer lover in KC.
The staff was very helpful, being as I was a new customer and was a little overwhelmed by all the topping choices!
It appears they also have around 40 different bottled beers available as well.
Really nice place with a great backyard area.
I am glad I made the stop to rehydrate in this part of the desert.
A fair sized place and rather busy during lunch time
Bold city will always hold a warm place in my heart as it was the George Washington of microbreweries in Jacksonville.
First of all this is in rather an odd place, tucked behind a mini mall.
I kinda have the feeling the concept of this brewpub was conceived by some interior design major first, and by a brewer second.
Whoever the artist was....frigging incredibly skilled person.
Thursday's are the brewery tour which is also a must.
Stopped in to this place on the corner of a bustling Crescent Street, although Dundees looked fairly empty for a Saturday night.
I still prefer the downtown location but this place is a beacon of light in Bel Air.
He has his own recipe for two beers that he alternates on tap and has brewed locally.
good variety of the expected national heavy hitters, regional and also bottle of local, lesser seen options.
Huge collection of rare bottles and an amazing selections of great beer on draft.
the food is good nothing that will blow your socks off, but you will not be disappointed.
Shots were a bit expensive and the food was too.
Those bumpy ass metal stools from middleschool art class.
The place was pretty easy to find in a large shopping complex near 95 and Butler Blvd.
w/ the beard know their shit and are more than happy to yenter it up
There isn't much for parking: the street or a small parking lot in the back.
Note - if you are a movie buff they don't have any exotic or hard to find movies you can't get off Netflix.
would definitely recommend when in the boulder area.
I might not have ever gone out here if it werent for my friend working there.
Ultimately I'd call it a defensible second or third choice for a beer hunter looking to eat well.
It was cold enough inside for me to go back to the car to get a jacket (and I am from Ohio, so I am used to the cold).
My wife and I grabbed a seat at the bar and the service from the bartenders was decent enough.
Usually something really good and unusual is flowing which is a good thing as I find the regular offerings somewhat pedestrian.
They had a pretty good glass selection, with the average glass costing about 10 Euro.
Prices are reasonable, especially for some of the hard to find stuff.
They have great beer release events such as for Williams Brothers Brewery or Sierra Nevada.
The people drinking there were great to chat with
and you told your wife you were just going to check it out
Narragansett's, and all sorts of in-betweens.
The atmosphere is very similar to Tap Room.
Staff can be a huge help (the assistant manager in particular) or no help at all.
The decorations are what I would think you would find in an Irish pub also.
The store had plenty of to go beer and souvenirs, from stickers to tap handles and signs.
The quality of the beer is decent but the service was really good and the people there were friendly.
There were about 50 people here on this day.
I prefer a quieter corner where we can eat and converse; just my opinion.
the beer selection is very good here particularly when it comes to six packs.
Always get a good solid meal, great sandwiches and I love the pub feel.
This large eating and drinking establishment is conveniently located across the street from Great American Ballpark.
But it was really chill, Bob was a solid dude.
But the food is at best mediocre compared to what they charge, especially the new chicken wings are just poor quality.
for the house beers, all of them that i had were good.
Draught beer (impressive rotating menu), growler fills (rotating), bottles (impressive beer garden), food (interesting, diverse menu).
full disclosure - dennis, the owner, is a good buddy of mine, but I love the place.
Some reviewers have noted that it's in a sketchy part of town, but I found it a nice change of pace from the flashier parts of the city and never once felt unsafe.
first thing i am struck by at SBC is the off crowd.
Located on busy Robson Street, on the second floor.
By far the best beer selection in winston.
These guys are just getting started, so not a lot in terms of selection on the day I visited in Sep 2016, but the quality is great.
Offer pretty much everything that the state allows.
So maybe I just like my local area but my first time actually going here was friday...
Actually they should just open another beer pub in the house next door to me.
English pub atmosphere greets you as you walk in.
They have a great new chef now, and this has allowed the brewer/manager to concentrate on his range of house beers once again.
Nice chill vibe if you want to escape the madness.
There's pool and darts, several TVs set to sports.
Reasonable pricing, including $8 for a flight of 4 beers or $10 for a flight of 5.
Vibe: laid back industrial scene intermixed with a lot of outdoor green space.
A dark beer without much depth but very easy to drink.
Import singles in the first couple doors, micros further down.
A laid back atmosphere, would love to go again and play some more games and sip a few good beers.
(my wife took me there straight from the airport) and I will never forget it for that reason.
I have toured the place, they have fermentation vessels downstairs and a really nice warehouse on the backside of the building.
it was awesome to finally be able to check these guys out!
The lighting was a bit obtrusive for 23:00 on a friday.
Maybe 4 or 6 pool tables around the place with a few dart boards.
As other comments have said, you need to look for it, because it is in a small room about 7 stairs down from the cheese store.
Anyway, he went to school with Chuck in another time in another other town on the very same lake.
Even when it is busy the pours still come quick and the staff never gets stressed.
If you like a little space and a volume that allows you to talk you should stick to the nearby Hop
The minute I entered the door, the guys working the counter were very friendly and extremely knowledgeable.
The decor is really beautiful and worth a visit because they don't make floors and ceilings and woodwork like this anymore.
It's tucked in the back of a parking lot in the college side of town, so it automatically feels a little remote.
I was able to stop by during one of my frequent trips to Jacksonville.
good kid back there pouring beers, not overly chatty but plenty friendly, and had no problem keeping up with the demand.
I enjoy conversation with Rich, but it gets to the point where his bad breath is almost unbearable while he stands so close speaking.
Nice patio outside, some tables inside, a pool table, a few tvs, and a couple video games.
With 50 taps and even more than that in bottles there is something for everyone, with that quantity I would hope for a better selection though.
I was expecting more from this as it is the local warehouse location.
This is the best pizza/brewery combination I have been to yet.
the patio is awesome in the summer, killer place to relax.
If you are not local and stop in, do yourself a favor and have some food!
This selection is decent, but hardly anything to write home about.
The Oxbow Portland location is a tremendous place.
Great shop located a few blocks from Rittenhouse.
The restaurant is a nice change of pace from the busy casinos.
The staff knows exactly what you are looking for, and can give you an honest answer when it comes to asking about something they don't have.
Visited late on a Friday night with a friend.
Great new brewpub in Logan Square, the food and cocktails outshined the house beers though.
Decor is beer casks and beer lists, all wood with some old dim lights.
When I heard that there was a new brewery going up in Ann Arbor
It's located in a pretty nice shopping center - I had to convince the wife not to go shopping elsewhere ($$$) while I checked out MB.
They had Stone IPA, Southern Tier IPA, West Coast DIPA.
The top-notch craft beer selection, the kid-freindly atmosphere
I mean the tasting room is pretty much the brewery itself!!
The flight, the drive in, the places seen, the grilled chicken sandwich 'et, and this long damn day doubtfully done still.
I recommend the Mad Poppers as a starter two Anaheim Chiles stuffed with goat cheese and light breaded and pan fried...
Awesome selection on draft, but very pricey (as expected by the niche brews).
They have an enourmous Pizza and Sandwhich list, and their soups and salads are pretty good too.
You can buy pizza by the slice from usually over a dozen different pizzas, or as whole pies, (including brick oven cooked).
The place is SUPER clean and extremely organized.
It's a fairly small location with some room at the bar to drink and some interesting looking tables as well.
Located in what seems to be an old family restaurant just adds to this place's charm.
Stopped in to grab a beer or two for a trip out Of town.
this was one of my favorite stops from our entire trip to new york, which was basically a brewery walkabout.
When we thought that we were close but still unable to find it we asked two students (who had never been there) for help
It's located on a quiet little strip near Honest Ed's, next to a few other restaurants.
The waitress came around somewhat often, though I think it could have been more.
They also have outdoor patio with picnic style tables (even in winter with heat).
Not worth your time so many better places in the area.
The food was good, although the burger was way under cooked.
North of downtown Las Vegas, Tenaya has a good selection.
I felt Id give the brand spanking new GC in Omaha a try.
Music was loud enough you could barely hear others at your table.
Ill try to go back to see a film on their terms
I love the selection of great craft beers at the World Bistro in Esco!
I have been there a few times over the years and it never disappoints.
Great atmosphere, Great food, wonderful draft beer selection, and some of the most knowledgeable bar tenders in Indy
The food is great, the beer selection is awesome!
The crowd is a good mix of beer nerds, local LP residents and metal heads, and it's very harmonious.
They have some very good selection of fine wines.
There doesn't seem to be any reason to the way things are layed out other by brewery, but this makes you look that much harder and it makes it more fun for me.
The brewer himself, Armando, is often pouring beers and filling growlers.
Was visiting Austin and as always have to find my way to one of the local beer spots.
First and foremost, this and Verdugo are my favorite spots in LA.
Stopped in here a few nights ago since a little birdie told me they still had some bottles of Parabola left.
TVs everywhere for obnoxious sports fans.
Also the Radler mix of Lager and lemon lime soda.
The decor and atmosphere is nice and clean.
My girlfriend and I sat in the dining room as opposed to being seated at the bar.
Kinda dimly lit, tons of reclaimed wood paneling, and even a "Press in case of raid" button.
A very good selection and often has things your local store never got or is already out of.
One wall is brick with DEMANDLESS cut into it another is made to look like a bookcase with broken glass behind the books.
Three taps on now with six as the objective.
Got to sample 4 beers afterwards, a nice plus, if you ask me.
our waitress was right there and knew what was on tap ..
No cask when i was there which was dissapointing.
Impressive selection of glassware, dozens of glasses to choose from and about 10 that I haven't found before.
The tap list is long - maybe 20 beers or so - and very local-heavy.
but they couldnt chat as much due to the crowd.
I visited this bar for the first time during my trip to Belgium in the last week of November, 2002.
Feels a bit corporate and chain-like, but nothing is offensive.
Both the bar and the back bar were unique in my travels, which is no small statement.
This place could handle a tone of German revelers.
The staff was knowledgeable and willing to help.
It's all located in a cool and hip part of town.
A good way to take the sting out of having to go shopping and go to LL Bean and Yankee Candle for the 100th time.
The food is tourist friendly traditional czech.
I have lived in UA all of my life and have visited Kenny Road Market over the years for their outstanding selection of beers.
Just moved to JP and decided to try Vee Vee this past weekend.
The food was good and the lunch special was very reasonable.
I didn't find anything on-tap that I was that interested in but bottle list was stellar
This place is a pretty damn good German restaurant and beer hall in the hayes valley area of downtown SF.
Very happy with the both the volume and variety of their selection.
My mom prefers going here and tells all of her friends about it.
My girlfriend has been telling me about this place for the past couple of weeks.
Not far from the Tampa Bay airport and the Picnic Island park and its Disc golf course.
It was also the last time we visited as the place seemed average in most ways.
It was a little dead that night (weird because it's Saturday and kind of scary)
The crowd is mixed, tending towards young, with a blend of locals and tourists.
A very conveniently-placed pub for lay-overs.
It doesn't smell good in here and there is virtually no place to stand during events.
Barn with higher-end restaurant (to be opening soon), outdoor seating areas.
I f***ing LOVE their house made pork rinds.
All good stuff, but nothing that made me jump for joy.
enter on the left front door,,wine is immediately in front of you
Staff is always very friendly and attentive even during their massive beer releases.
Almost every major style was there along with a nice balance of east and west coast beers and belgiums.
I went to NO for a bachelor party a few weeks ago.
It's got a great vibe, and all the beers I tried were quite good indeed but for one or two exceptions.
but it is very close to me(greater cincy/nky)if
Giant sausage and buscuits were inexpensive and desperately needed.
Been to the Bistro many a time and It has never disappointed.
If you aren't interested in the brewery part you could come, eat, and go and never even see it if you didn't want to.
Nice that there were two rooms but main bar way too dark and having giant tv of cage fighting
This used to be my local spot when I lived on Rosedale St
Nice little place that makes up for quantity of selections with quality.
The Cellar Bottle Shop is located in Uptown Whittier.
Has a very extensive selection of beers and the prices are quite reasonable (thus, the name).
Krogers and Giant eagles have better selections.
But really, nearby La Trappe dominates this place, and that's not even considering La Trappe's awesome moules frites.
You'll spend ages simply flicking through the beer menu, I always close my eyes, open it and point randomly, and hasn't let me down!
As an aside, they also have a nice selection of signature cocktails, (Sazerac anyone?)and and a very good and affordable wine list.
that guy for not only yelling at a really nice hostess but also yelling at other customers.
The menu is limited to sandwiches however you can order from nearby restaurants and have food delivered.
The inside, where we sat, was empty at first, but filled up quickly.
I'd be surprised if anyone actually goes here to have a beer, so the staff is not a knowledgeable bunch about craft stuff.
Stopped in here before I went over to Brawleys and Total Wine one day cause,
Minimal hop presence, even in their "IPA.
As a matter of fact they only had one of the 6 NHL games available.
The Belgian selection is small but will satisfy most Belgian lovers.
Staff are very 'chill' btu not aloof or cold.
Really cool guys and can only imagine how it is when it is really rocking.
I didn't really notice if they had a bottle list or not.
Old Bag of Nails pubs keep springing up in different places around Columbus.
I dominated a burger (lots of good vegetarian offerings
The place is pretty big and there's even a small parking lot outside, which is a bonus in this neighborhood.
Afterwards, he gave me literature to help the first time brewer obviously a self written work of love.
Very friendly service, and usually very efficient.
Walking into The Barley Mill Pub and sitting down at the bar I felt like I was in Telluride.
Norm's is located in a little mini-mall in a corner store in Vienna, Virginia.
Not the best selection in the world by a long shot, mind you, but surprisingly diverse.
Postdoc Brewing is located immediately adjacent to Marymoor park in Redmond, and they were pretty full on the nice day I visited.
holding off on too harsh a judgement here, these guys are brand new and obviously still figuring it out.
Our waitress came with menus and a basket of bread, and luckily she spoke decent English (even though I pretty much ordered completely in French...and she understood me...
some of the stables where they have the horses that pull the beer wagons down the street for the parade, just like they have done for generations.
Prices are unbeatable about a dollar less then others.
Many more rare and aged beers in bottles.
Quality of the space and the beers was outstanding.
I will not get into details about the horrific things that were said.
It's one of those stores where I'll need to set a dollar limit before I enter because I could easily get carried away.
Fantastic patio in the back for nice days.
Can get some amateurs and yahoo's on the weekends, but overall the clients are great.
As others have said it has a minimalist feel to it.
Thur you get 3 bucks off a growler of one of the 3 beers on tap in the shop.
The crowd is a great mix of locals from Mount Airy and Chestnut Hill & is extremely friendly.
Terrific restoration of a heritage building resulting in a spacious, relaxed, open concept tasting room that flows into the brewery.
There is a processing vessel that is in use in the main brewery room
small bar on one side, a dining room set up on the back side, and some visible equipment through a clear wall in the back.
A great place for a number of reasons, some of which actually relate to beer.
Merchandise selection and service are great.
I'm not sure why every tour isn't that way; I mean, it is a brewery, right?
Pricing is fair and they have a good selection of craft brew amongst a large selection of Belgian beer.
I’m closeby to where I need to be, but I don’t have a lot of time...
If you go to Macniven's you absolutely HAVE to try the scotch eggs.
Their selection is the most impressive I have found in Belgium for a beer store.
and I got to try beers from Founders, Arcadia, and Thirsty Dog.
Was down in the Gaslamp district of San Diego, saw this store was close and figured I should stop by based on reviews.
The bartender there when I visited was awesome.
A pretty big brewery that offers a food menu from a food truck on site which is a BBQ place
Any place that has Pliny on tap gets points automatically.
I went in the spring and they didn't have any special beers on tap, so I picked from their standard lineup.
This pub is near where I currently work, but I haven't tried it until recently, a pub-outing with some of my coworkers after work.
And the bottle shop/tap trailer next door is really nice as well.
Alex and Gretchin are great owners, very knowledgeable and personable, and truly have a must-visit establishment.
Most, if not all, of the staff are from the UK and the bar is very much going for a "foreign" feel.
Visited san diego and looked up beer stores on BA.
Not a bad spot in a town with quite a few nice beer locales in close proximity to each other.
Considering the volume of other places I haven't visited, it probably won't go here again, but was worth a first visit.
Staff and service was awesome and they had a solid variety of beer got a flight along with a few pints.
Cool vibe, and will only get better once the construction is complete, good beer with roughly 10 taps to choose from.
I had done quite a bit of research before heading into the store, but the guys working were more than willing to help me with my little questions.
I miss so much Harvey's beers since moving to London from Sussex a year ago, though here
You can sit around for awhile or you can get in and out before a game.
Inside, the bar is actually pretty small.
I stopped by with my son before a Butler basketball game.
They had a pretty standard lineup on of about 5-6 beers that you could get pints of in snazzy clear plastic cups.
They are having a keep your glass promotion on Thurs in March...
Absolutely friendly staff, even to the point of remembering your name between visits.
I loved how I could order on the internet and they had it packed and ready for pickup.
The selection was very nice with all the Trappists (except Westvletern), Catillion,
The location is great - right on the Redondo Beach Pier.
Not a big fan of the constant hyping on Facebook and instagram and twitter, especially when your bottle limit is 1.
There are always 3 or 4 beers I would be happy to have.
I have a love-hate relationship with this store.
Entrance over looks the taproom and one walks down to the small straight bar against left hand wall of taproom.
Its great to stop by a store and drink a beer while shopping.
One of three Whole Foods I visited in Portland.
It's an upscale vibe that reminded me of a cafe you'd see in New Orleans.
Visited this place the other night for the first time, even though I've lived here for a nearly a decade.
I think he’d be proud of the fine beer now served here.
Despite the limited seating and visiting during a First Friday's event in the Crossroads, seating was still available - and remained available throughout the night.
They had rare beer after rare beer as I scrolled through the selection.
The clean and classy building is located near the downtown district with a nice view of the river outside the main dining area and the bar.
I think both Westmalles were on draft last time
I had a pint of Troegs, and bottles ($4.50 each) of Acadia London Porter and Mad River Steelhead Extra Pale Ale.
I was lucky enough to grab a seat by the window and got to enjoy some great beer in a great city.
Gomer's is the best selection in Kansas City proper.
Serendipitously reconnected with someone from my past.
My personal favorite brewery of breweries!
visited the weekend of the World Beer Festival...always in search of good BBQ when I make my way back down to NC - the stuff I've had up in VA just doesn't compare
They had about 150 bottles and another 30 taps.
They brew their beers onsite and they are good beers too!
Same w/ the beers which disappointed me a little - some of the beers I had were real good, most "menhh" and one was rather bad.
This place is just as advertised as it should be: a massive liquor store somewhat near the U that will house a large selection to choose from.
Best of all, the upscale clientele were offset by some really rough types that made me wonder what would happen if I ever raised my voice in vulgarisms at IHLNC.
They have brick oven pizza and picnic tables inside and outside with lots of games to play.
If Brix and Beertopia have already sold out, head to Cubby's.
The pints are reasonably priced, with most being $4.50 when I was there.
Recommended by staff at Moeder Lambic, and we were very pleased.
I drove down to Portland from Seattle yesterday, and while a trip to John's wasn't my only objective, it was right at the top of the list.
It's still a bit stuffy for my tastes, and I doubt i'd go here for a drink
Now this is a pub that did disappoint me a bit.
I was glad to find a part for my keg system
pint, snitfter and oversize wine glasses available for the various styles of beer.
If you can talk to Levi, he has a ton of knowledge about beer.
I wouldn't say that any of the beers were bad, but pretty simple, not much complexity or depth going on.
First off the service was great and the women bartender was excellent (sorry forgot your name).
Plus their buy 10 kits get one free promotion is just a cherry on top.
If you are in NYC head directly to the East Village and make this a MUST STOP!!!!
A very neat setting with shellacked wood and stained glass.

The Brew Pub was a nice finishing touch to the Abita Brewery Tour.
Food was very good and the beer options made this visit a nice experience.
Being a Texan myself, the owner gushed over Jester King.
I liked this place and will definitely return soon.
I liked every beer I tried, which was about 14 of them
Great location in the historic distillery district.
I had read great reviews of this place and
There are televisions everywhere playing all sports.
Listening to the church bells while drinking Andechs at noon on beautifully clear sunday could be pretty high on my list of things to do.
and Uber is a good way to spend an evening.
Great pizza food truck outside that will deliver to your seat inside the bar.
A 15 year old kid greeted us at the front, and seated us by the bar on request.
Service was excellent and the food was above average.
Ashley's is the kind of place I can't imagine thriving in Toledo
, GN is still a welcome addition to the neighborhood I think.
Our order was accurate, and the food was delicious.
A decent amount of mass produced lagers and ales that may be good for business but do bring down my score for quality.
Beautiful long wood bar is the feature of the place, and pleasant place to be.
The breakfast event was food made with beer.
why would I even think of eating Maine Lobster in HI.
If you sign up for their e mail they will
Small premium on price but well worth it.
Stopped in for a late lunch with my wife and son on a Wednesday.
The service at the bar great and can't wait to go back again
Suzanne is a BA member and occasionally updates us on what she receives.
Open for a couple years, this place has really found its groove.
Overall their beers are pretty boring and have no distinct style.
Not a Flying Saucer, or Mellow Mushroom, but more than just Guiness, and Yuengling.
Ryan's has probably the best selection in town and even better selection than some stores searched in a trip to Detroit.
I've been to this bar several times, often on weekends.
Nice place down near the Dechutes River in downtown Bend.
A little small and can seem real busy due to location.
You are a chump if you go to SD and don't hit the BP Taproom!
This place is more than just a beer bar, but also a beer store.
Was crowded on a Friday night for the Stone pub crawl.
Large row of coolers with tons of craft and import bombers.
A good brewery that used to be much better.
Waitress was nice enough to bring samples, but all underwhelmed.
Nice feel to this place, good tap selection.
I smiled at my good fortune, but of course they immediately switched it to some whiny nü-metal.
A few pool tables, a foosball table and some pinball machines are immediately to the left of the entry.
The list they give isn't always the most updated so be sure to ask your server.
They have nearly 20 beers on tap, with none of the American mega-breweries listed.
That said, the restaurant side still has plenty of sports paraphernalia and TV viewing.
Lots of stuff on the walls, dark, wierd signs, graffiti.
On my first trip to Earth Bread yesterday, the bartender recommended that I check this tavern out.
The space isn't very nice looking, however.
first of all, I showed up right as the shipment of Bourbon County Stout showed up.
One of the best craft and import selections I have seen.
An adjunct-forward brewery doing unique things in a strip mall on the northwest corner of Indy.

I had the korean tacos and the kale salad.
but they served up barbeque sausages and white bread.
I stayed in Antwerp during my Belgium visit of Easter 2001.
Indoor taps, outdoor taps, great patio, plenty of free parking across the street.
Some cheers as Detroit hit a couple home runs, obviously people are here for sports in addition to the beer and food.
The last stop on the Bloomsbury and Holborn pub crawl set up by fellow BA wl0307 (Yau), and attended by myself, my girlfriend, Yau's girlfriend, and BA greencard.
The Wendell store has a good selection of beer and wine, with an in house book shop.
On my recent visit (Oct 2008) I decided to push the boat out
a highlight from our oregon trip for sure
They also sell cider, mead, wine and have a small selection of homebrew equipment and supplies.
Bathrooms were very psychodelic with multi-colored spray paint to deter graffitti, but it really didn't.
I’ve been going to Cato’s off and on for a long time now.
Stoolies is a great place to catch a game, lots of televisions around tuned to sports.
Favorite part: You can mix your own six packs with anything in the store.
Their beer selection, while small, is certainly delicious.
I had never been to a true bottle shop before, pretty cool.
Overall the place is small and cozy with some tables available for dinner and a small bar.
It was a quaint little place at first, then became a constantly packed little place.
Finally got a chance to check them out on a Saturday night.
Only problem is that a lot of the beers (specifically certain IPAs or Pale Ales) are well past their best by date.
Lots of parking across the railroad tracks.
the bar staff is usually good on getting your order
we enjoyed several pints and a a few snacks here.
you can see the brewhouse from the bar, and then a lot of nice sort of intimate booth seating around.
Beautiful place to go eat by the water in downtown Tampa.
They recently started marketing some of their brews in cans - including the Shiva IPA, which is one of their better offerings.
Came here for a quick beer after a trade with hoppypocket and i'm glad i did.
The Great Great Great Gam Gam, an American Double, is one of my all time favs.
i highly recommend a visit or two, and more.
I unfortunately didn't write any reviews because I was with my son, but will next time.
Grabbed some beers from the bar way in the back.
Seriously great spot for friends who share a love for beer.
A mix of ales and lagers (although ales were favored in the spread).
There is not much to the OG Trillium location, really just a bar that has growler fills by the door and cans on the opposite end.
Add one more to the list of "must-see" on a beer tour of Cleveland.
Nice open, bright and airy tap room that has their core beers plus a couple of small batch beers on tap.
However, upon inquiring about some of the stuff on the bottle list, they seemed to be out of everything I was interested in such as their Alpine and Russian River listings.
My favorite late night hangout spot in Philly.
They have numerous, maybe ten, beers on tap.
This location used to be a nice wine shop with a a hand full of craft beers.
I enjoyed the Barley House Classic (sirloin burger) & onion rings with some spicy ketchup.
There was a definite focus on chocolate stouts, some of which I hadn't heard of before.
It is very nice to have a Dogfish Head Alehouse so close so that one can get their great beers on tap!
you walk through the dining area to get to the L
Still if you are a resident who has never been to the Vortex or are planning a trip to Atlanta
Best beer selection in Munich in my opinion, loved getting to try the full gamut of Schneider & Sohn brews, so damn tasty.
Been in several times over the years, the service was poor - young guys who'd rather bullshit than help you out.
They have a kitchen bar you can sit at and watch the food being prepared.
Being that they focus on local and organic is a huge plus as well.
Aces and Ates and Expedition stouts were new arrivals for late fall.
Spotted this one while looking for a place to eat after an Avery release party.
Not bad getting Captain Lawrence Kolsch and Geary's Pale Ale for $3.
A handful of TVs play sports games, with the crowd cheering on the game (despite neither team being local).
The beer selection is decent, but not huge.
Stopped by here on my way through Tigard today.
Great feel when you walk in, with lots of dark wood and brick balancing with a ton of windows that allow natural light to flood the space.
Most recently it had a short stint as canavan's and maker's local, two ill-fated establishments
During a terrible snow and cold freeze of early February 2007, I did a white-knuckler western Michigan loop consisting of the top-rated brewpubs in Western Michigan.
Plenty of board games, 1 or 2 pool tables, and a shuffleboard table.
They do have a very good selection, you won't be disappointed.
The beers were average as well, probably the lowest ratings I've ever given on-site brewed beers.
if you have time to sit for about 20 minutes after being seated before the server comes over to you, then this is your place.
Lively lunch crowd the day I was there, the place is definitely popular with the locals.
Lots and Lots of really tasty beers to choose from -- in singles, six packs and bombers..
Silver moon, located on greenwood avenue seems to be the more 'hip' location as far as brewpubs in town.
It's a bit dark, but that's part of the atmosphere, I think.
Spoke with one of the brewmasters, Carlos.
Went there last weekend on Sunday while I was there for a family wedding.
The feel is lively but quiet and not even remotely rowdy from my experiences.
On our first visit it seemed too crowded to wait to eat, but we did wait on our second visit.
Service is usually great, all the servers really know beer.
The place was rather empty but there was a wait when I left about 90 minutes later.
Fairly small, with no bells and whistles, but you do not have to wait for more than a few seconds for a beer.
the location is behind a motel so very secluded.
A traditional Dutch brown cafe, not far from Central Station.
The brewery is located in an industrial area and the spot itself is industrial.
Fairly large brewpub that's located in the suburbs.
Mostly though I love that they are laid back
A very small number of modern table and chair sets lie scattered here and there.
They have a handful of local offerings but nothing spectacular.
Being a frequent patron to that bar in college, I definitely noticed some similarities to this bar.
I was looking for some stuff that's not available in these parts.
Walk in and looks like a complete local place.
As far as the beer goes, this was my favorite place.
The outdoor space is fantastic in the daytime and at night.
This is a must stop if you are driving up 95 or route 1.
Visited on the Sunday afternoon of 2010 ZBF weekend.
Bartender was very engaging, interested in what we liked, trying to find something that fit.
But is a little limited on supplies and is a little smaller than some home brew stores ive been too.
but if I know somewhere else has something I really want
Cool Irish pub with lots of craft and european beer options, 25+ drafts.
Maybe that disqualifies me from reviewing the place?
Service was a bit spoty but also only one server this night
I've heard the owner is great to talk to, and was from the small chat we had, but I intentionally didn't get to involved as I had a hungry wife waiting back at the hotel
He did give us his 3 needs notebook to contribute to, which was fun.
Have to say, I wish this place was in NW., but then again, if it was, it would be even more crowded.
The food is truly excellent, upscale pub grub of the stick-to-your-ribs variety, although there should be something for everyone.
A very nice guy who I had a lot of fun talking about and sharing a beer with.
Booth' tables have old airline seats and other rundown chairs, which adds to the style of the place.
This is a lovely, classic Belgian Beer cafe, next to the Antwerp theatre.
Ah stub and herbs how i love how much you have changed into a craft beer bar, since i used to go to you four years ago for Gopher's hockey games when I was in college.
Of course, you can't hear what they're saying so why not just give in to a good old Red Sox game?
The floor inside expands to the brewing area in the back where the magic happens.
This is a more subdued experience than Hofbrauhaus, but worth the visit for sure.
They've been in the game a long time now, and they've pretty much got their groove going.
For such a huge operation I would have liked to see more options on tap though.
When you walk in the first thing you notice is the numerous coolers of craft beer lined against the walls.
Transcribed from extensive noted taken F, 07 Aug 2009.
The venue has a good size bar but too few stools ..
Basically, you're gonna have to refrigerate it if you go here
I try to stop by for happy hour every once in a while - which is great by the way...
and he was very cool and knowledgeable about beer.
It's a sister pub to Feierabend and Prost!
you're greeted by the huge bottle selection in a wall of coolers behind the bar.
My biggest complaint is by far the location.
Beer, wine and liquor all share the confined shelf space, as well as the fridge.
Get a street map, locate the brewpubs, and enjoy the great beers they have.
And, no … I have no idea what "boursin" is.
Awesome little spot on the out skirts of town, small building in a non descript kinda area
I never had a Belhaven stout until I went there.
It is usually crowded, energetic, loud, etc.
a little evolving needs to happen for this place to really live up to its potential...
Parking can be miserable too, unless you go valet.
so really there was 35 taps….well 5 out of the 7 beers I ordered
Value is pretty good, especially coming from Washington DC.
If the staff can shake the 'tudes and smile every now and again, that would be an improvement.
Only down sides may be the crowds that flock here during busy times, and the fact that the prices are a bit high ($26 for a 375ml Hanssens lambic?
It has sort of an old-time feel with wooden bars, tables, chairs, floors, etc.
I was there during happy hours so most beers were priced at $3-4 which would be great for a full pint of beer.
Aside from the great selection, Mellow Mushroom's pizza is unlike any other you will try outside NY.
Did not try the food as I did not even hang around long enough to grab a cold one as this was just really not my style of place.
We visited during their two year anniversary and the event was awesome.
Sculpin, Hopslam, Stone 14th IIPA, and Racer 5 and Dugana on tap when I was there.
As the name implies, this larger place looks like and feels like a supermarket...
Every beer is top notch, always finding new beers I love.
It's pretty smokey even by bar standards, but the overall atmosphere is pretty nice and inviting; it just feels like a quiet local place.
Once you enter there are booths, tables/chairs, bar and an outside patio area.
The food as part of Restaurant week was very good
The food, beer, service, and atmosphere of this place just tend, invariably, to be a cut-above.
I particularly liked the Bitter Life IPA coffee-infused version and also the Saucy Intruder rye IPA.
He shared some one year old lambic he brought back from the brewery in a plastic bottle.
A glass window with huge brewing supplies gazing at you.
There are other places I would rather go, but I wouldn't turn it down if I was staying in the area and wanted a good beer.
I felt they ran from "good" to "need to have again".
The food was great, the catfish po boy was outstanding.
I wrote a great story about a Budweiser swilling, redneck lowlife who goes to Prague on vacation.
Beer on top is solid, and some good bottles.
we had some nachos from their newly opened kitchen which were only okay, but its all about the beer here.
Visited during DC beer sojourn with the ever-knowledgeable John Michaelsen, I totally agree with John that this place is rated far too low.
However, I was quite trashed sooooo look at other reviews.
no need to expound on what's already been said, but i'll echo their sentiments.
It's definitely worth a stop here if you are in the area.
They also fill growlers at a great price given their tiny brew house.
I have been getting it for years and have driven quite a distance just to get it on occassion.
i look forward to their continued growth and wish them luck.
the "chain" craft brewery, that has plenty of options for it's customers, just nothing to write home about.
A reasonably attractive room with a nautical theme
The place was pretty full with the after-work crowd, but service was efficient nonetheless.
the mall, as in the whole place is open to it.
Busy, but still easy to find a spot on the patio!
I'm sure service is fine under more normal conditions.
I was there in about 45 minutes but was told I missed it by 15 minutes (no problem).
I did sample the food here, and it was a bit disappointing for the price.
Food can be ordered from the nearby shops.
I love the squirrel mural on the wall, and how many places go to the effort of putting speakers in their loo so you can still listen to the music?
although in this case it was a bit too barrel-y).
The bottle selection is equally impressive.
Get over yourself, your not the only rodeo in town
They never closed during WWII, so those yeasts just continue to age and spread - one of few true, natural fermentation lambics.
In fact, after I moved to Irvington I found very few beer stores that sold much more than Coors Light and Sam Adams
On walkabout, now just up the block from that 1st Florida brewery we’ve seen so many times before.
Just being able to sit so close to 24 taps and ask for a flight of your choice of those beers is amazing.
I lived on 14th and Meridian when this place opened up last year.
and then there is a special beer or two or three that they put on a blackboard
I just happened upon this place by chance since the AirBNB we were staying at was right down the street.
The barmaids were very friendly to us and were joking about some American actress who was in who had to tell them who she was...
Must be the place to be in South End right now...
They also have a big selection of wine to keep the wine enthusiast busy while you have a beer.
I love the concept of a brewery with a tasting room and a rotating cast of food trucks outside.
So head's up: I'm reviewing this in October 2012 and Packs and Dogs has only just finished a major renovation this month!
Overall a very pleasant and comfortable shopping experience.
Avoid the place on weekend nights it reminds me of my fraternity house parties.
The tasting room is on the small side, but has a bar and tables with board games you can play.
The other thing I liked was the staff recommendation tags.
I went to Flanny's to have the special keg of Firestone Parabola (which was amazing by the way).
Apparently this has been an issue for a while that has not been fixed.
Overall a very good experience; would go back in a heart beat.
Jester King, Adelbert's, Austin Beerworks, new Lips of
I just want to add to the praise of Stearns Liquor Mart by saying that the place is run by the nicest guy I've ever met in a beer store.
went on a weekday eve for a quick couple while watching soccer.
Pretty good selection, when I was there saw lots of founders, firestone walker, green flash, and others I can't get back in SC.
Decor was good and the bar was just huge.
tap and mallet it is a great place if you like good beer and hate overly crowded places with blasting music
A place for regulars who don't go out to normal night time entertainment establishments.
The place was a mess and had a bunch of dusty old bottles that were ready for the drain.
and I think they have outgrown their taproom.
Pacific Plate Brewery is a only a few months old
Beers run the gamete from really good to mediocre.
If i was reviewing just Tom's beer this review would be an A+
The meat pies are good and filling, but again not exceptional.
The cooler is huge, and all of their beer is in there, which has both its pros and cons.
Atmosphere at this place was really nice.
These guys are really knowledgeable about both beer and wine.
I have been meaning to try this place out for a while, glad I finally got around to it.
looks like they mix it up quite a bit and brew some rather small batches,
Likewise the beer selection was decent, though it did not seem to feature everything currently available from DFH at the micro/craft brew store.
Kramerbooks was a cinch to find on Connecticut just North of Dupont Circle.
My "$" inexpensive rating applies only if you are to go on a Thursday, in which case it will be $2 pints of any of their own beers.
But that thought was quickly followed by, "Not really anything special or different from the other bars around Fort Collins, either."
The regulars are business suits, locals, and some Irish.
but you can bring your own in and with Dewey's Pizza, and at least 3 other restaurants in the same shopping plaza, you won't starve.
It's definitely a great place to grab something quick but for the beer nerd I'd recommend MARTYS DISCOUNT LIQUORS or Craft Beer Cellar in Belmont.
15 beers on tap, nice assortment of styles.
Corridor was a neat place in a cool trendy location.
My co-worker knew about the Tap House and when he discovered that I kinda liked
Space is pretty utilitarian, some tables and some benches.
The burger was outstanding and the fries were not bad.
There are now roughly 20 cooler doors, all beer is refrigerated, with the exception of one shelf of gift packs and a Goose Reserve display.
Prices were a little on the high side - but it's quality stuff
The main space is an ideal space to take in a game and throwback a few pints with friends.
Where we were seated we could only see a number of large tubes running to the ceiling,
Went here a few weeks ago on my way to talk about beer.
Huge inventory to choose from, visit the place and you will be amazed.
Sounds like the owner is willing to do what it takes to get some beer into the place.
again, not the type of place in which you'll spend an hour just poring over all the options, but definitely some quality beers to be had.
Food was an Asian fusion theme very tasty, a bit pricy.
but I would say any of them are worth a try.
This was my second stop on a trip to Asheville this weekend.
A great place for lunch, or anytime, really.
They usually open up a bit of space into the brewery for events, busy days, etc.
I then ventured to the menu to see that they had a gumbo that came highly recomended by the bartender.
They always have plenty of decent beer to choose from and the service is good, but that smell was terrible.
Don't get me wrong, not all the people here were unpleasant but let's just say I won't be going back here again and leave it at that.
Service is good, but can be slow on busy nights.
A recent visit found the 14 taps to have a good selection, I had 2 Firestone Walker DBAs, and a small but nice selection of bottles and cans (including Oskar Blues).
service was awesome, friendly and informative, and more than happy to share samples, even pull samples from the back to taste.
I really felt comforatable sitting there drinking fresh Samuel Smiths
When I finally found someone, the answers I received were dismal.
There is a limited tap/bottle selection, but what is offered is always exclusive and delicious.
It was out of the way but the cab ride was well worth it .
we happened upon Exile when we checked into our hotel room in Des Moines and just googled local breweries.
The place gets busy on the weekends and during events but with room outside, around the barrels and at the tables you can find some room on a nice day.
Definately worth checking out and highly recommended.
This brewery is conveniently located about two blocks away from an interchange on the Ventura Freeway.
It feels like a seattle brewpub with the excellent selection of beers and the great bunch selection.
, almost went for a half fill of each but don't need any more growlers in my growing collection, if I lived local, different story.
I don't know if it was the owner or manager
A nice selection of beers in a nice atmosphere.
The atmosphere is warm and the prices, especially compared to the quality of their product, is outstanding.
The store is pretty big, was really clean, seemed pretty up-scale.
If you go in alone you have a good chance of meeting new friends.
The portions are generous but the price is a bit steep.
the vibe is unlike your typical beer bar in ny.
This place has been here for a fairly long time now, and if memory serves, was at one time one of the better destinations in town for craft beer.
I would expect to be able to do it here, but I cant.
It feels old inside, but doesn't "look" like it needs refurbishing.
I always receive exceptional service while at the bar; it's never too crowded and typically I am very happy with their draft selection.
Pretty small place in a strip mall area parking is tough if the place is very busy.
They have an excellent selection for such an establishment, and it's a fun place to go for an Oktoberfest get-together.
I missed the limited release last summer and had been kicking myself since.
They pack a good, lively crowd even early in the week.
Definitely worth a return visit next trip to the Windy City.
Quite a few taps, a beer engine, and a decent bottle list.
Added to those searching for better on tap can have: Columbus Brewing's Pale Ale, Goose Island's Honker Ale, Elevator Brewing's Coal Porter and Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold.
Their own ales include a very good American IPA and a very nice, dry Imperial Stout.
This place is a complete dive, and it is awesome for that reason.
Still seeming to be a work in progress, this new beer in a shopping plaza that itself is under construction has the nuts and bolts in place.
With anything from Head high IPA, Double overhead
Some of the usual (like the french dip) and some pretty odd stuff on the menu.
Visited Nov 2016 swing thru SD with Will.
Pretty non-descript look from the outside, but what a joy on the inside.
Visited on Tuesday 13th December, still classed as 'soft opening' having opened its doors for the first time on Saturday the 10th
This location is very close to work, so it's easy for me.
, there is another brewery around the corner.
I don't know how it got such a high rating to begin with.
Seems like a nice local pub to have a decent beer and food that will not crush your wallet.
This neighborhood is very special and the beautiful urban in-fill business locale is a throwback to an earlier time.
Pub crawlers, take note that the Rose & Raindrop is within stumbling distance.
But it sure is nice to be able to go to the movies for the beer.
The prices are reasonable and selection great.
All beers were appropriately served (glasses, temperature, portions), and while not cheap, they were priced reasonably considering the quality.
Three Squares offers the full line of Summit beers, along with other local favorites like Surly Bender.
It's in more of a residential neighborhood, and not in Montreal's 'tourist zone.'
In Michigan, $9.99 seems to be the entry level, and plenty of brewers are hitting the $11.99 price point for even basic offerings
The food was OK, menus were available in French and English.
Unfortunately, the N. 7th St. location is now closed.
The music is a little too loud but a good selection.
Surprised that the Libertine hasn't been reviewed in over a year
I really wanted to check out the beer garden
Since it is a residential neighborhood, parking could be difficult; however, Bus 28 from downtown runs right by the front door.
there is plenty of talking going on w/ all the bodies.
Great bartenders and awesome fishing vibe.
- went during the day so none of that for me.
Always cool to be able to see the magic happen.
I've since stolen that recipe and make a better version at home.
Great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a fresh pint with a good bite to eat in downtown Buffalo...
True aficionados can opt for bottle service, the way this was intended.
Snacks and artisan style brick oven pizzas.
I've been trying to find a better beer bar in the area but keep coming back to Ashley's because nobody can compete with the selection.
This was my last stop of the night on my Short North crawl.
The selection is huge with plenty of Colorado brews, a few odd imports, and a well-picked selection of west coast beers (Russian River, The Bruery, etc.).
Small booths and some tables surround the bar area.
I recently visited this establishment and not only have their prices gone up but their beer selection has dwindled.
From the outside, one would think Benno's is just another Milwaukee-area tavern, but viewing the taps is a pleasant surprise.
There's a kids menu, so lunch with the family is no problem.
I liked what was on tap more during my first visit than this one.
She knew all the brews to the nodes taste as they changed thru temperatures.recomend a visit if in the area.
Connected to the store is a casual bar with a nice tap selection.
The IPAs are IPAs, the saisons are saisons, and so forth.
L shaped bar as you walk in on your right and seating and a stage to the left.
Took a bit of a search to find it, but if you get to the imposing statue of Jan Van Eyck you are on the right track.
but I suggest going just to drink and get food later.
Great selection of both cold IPA's and rare stuff on the shelves.
A very consistent and pleasant brewery to visit.
This laid back, friendly draft house has become my favorite place to grab a pint and eat some delicious food while watching my favorite sports games.
I'm new to the craft beer world and fell in love with super HOPPY beers (IPA).
Ale Asylum is quickly and easily accessible from I-90/94.
Friendly guys and gals pouring incredible beer, local folks drinking and chatting, and out-of-towners like me enjoying good beer.
The beer is great had Morning Wood and Central Waters BA Stout.
Finally, I stopped in with MDS on Sunday and it was fairly quiet, so we decided to stay for a beer.
This just happened to be right on our way when we needed to make a pit stop, and I'm really glad it was.
6:00 on a Wednesday so no expectation of vibe...
" There's a wall of bottles, as well as four fridge units, all of which are tantalizingly tempting.
The prices are reasonable and comparable to just about every other shop in San Diego.
A good selection of beer and with DC ABC laws sometimes a crazy variety.
We also met a guy there that runs a homebrew group, and they were having a meeting later that night.
Definitely be back there when I get the chance.
I quaffed several half-liters of their delectable dark lager (dunkles) and gorged myself with a savory sausage platter.
There was plenty of space, clarity of menu and friendly service to go around.
all of the beer was really solid, way ahead of expectations, and this sort of changes my opinion a little bit about big business in craft beer.
The atmosphere is lively but still cool and toned down.
Love the hummus and chips with blue cheese that come with the meal.
The inside was very dark with red lighting....
Nice list on tap and bottle list was mind blowing, including Fou Foune.
The menu also does a great job of describing the different beers, without overloading a novice with too much info that would just go in one ear and out the other.
Solid atmosphere, but really it's all about service, selection and value.
I knew I would be a regular here for years to come.
Recent trip to an old timer, I remember going here way back when...
The place is very artsy, with paintings and photos hanging everywhere.
Stopped in here on Tuesday afternoon (10-26-10).
There was nothing particularly exciting or disappointing about it.
i loved the salad i had here, but am already dying to go back and dive a little deeper into their food menu.
Beer selection has a good variety and the beer I had was good; got to talk with one of the brewers/owners (both?)
The walls are adorned with beer signs of a wide variety of brewerys both European and American micros.
Had to ask the helpful guys in the gas station next door to guide us.
I must say that this establishment met all my expectations regarding being highly disorganized and also a gold mine of beer.
In exile in Western Pennsylvania for 13 weeks, I've been scouting out brewpubs and beerbars primarily in Pittsburgh.
(I brought my 9 year old daughter and she wrote these down for me;)
Service is rather slow on the patio but mainly do do servers have ten table sections.
Awesome, just there on new year's eve for lunch.
I have never had a problem with the service.
Located in the sleepy residential locale of Bridgeport, alleged "Community of the Future", home to one crazy asian Jay23.
In the old Schmidt brewery complex in the newly opened Keg & Case.
The list has the feel of many of the great, curated selections found in the city.
My two experiences with the Moose's Tooth were pretty similar.
Family friendly, there are pinball games and darts in the back.
At least there's more to choose from and I found some decent ones here.
They have a small bar, tables, a pool table in the middle of it all and an outdoor patio area.
Awesome location with great views from the upper deck of the bay, watching the seaplane and ferry action.
Spacious and comfortable, a perfect venue for a day drink on the weekend.
The edge-y demeaner of the bar is exciting, intriguing, and slightly intimidating.
anywhere nearby you should make a stop and check the "wall of beer"
However, the food was quite good and fresh.
Just remember it runs parellel to 71 on the WEST side of the highway so cross over to that side as soon as you exit.
Knowledgeable, helpful and went above and beyond to help me out with some local and regional beers including some rare and limited releases.
In my time there, I found the other patrons to be friendly and engaging.
It seems like a shame to call it bar food.
It took a few moments for our waiter to come over, not a big deal we weren't in a rush and knew that this place is pretty laid back.
The service was good... very friendly and attentive.
I kept asking if it had beef in it, didn't occur to me to ask about pork.
It's located inside and on the ground floor of an office building.
You been to one TW you've been to them all...
Their taproom serves multiple gems on tap, plus have a few refrigerators holding their bottles.
Jay, Aaron, and Cliff have really got it going here.
When you walk in it seems a bit angular and shiny for a beer bar, but you still feel invited in.
4.5 for selection might be a somewhat high rating, but you can't really ask for a better selection in a grocery store.
The area was small and chopped up but the there was an Upscale atmosphere.
Overall, I would probably frequent Groveland Tap quite a bit if I lived in the neighborhood.
There is a good amount of cold beer along the back wall.
The taproom has more of a feeling of a retail store that it does a taproom, possibly because there is no seating.
but if you a re in TW, you aren't there for the ambience.
im sure it was a fluke, and the beer was good enough to go back for, so definitely still check them out when you are in bend.
As Nero has stated this Tavern like so many others in its time was more then just a tavern (to learn more, check out the website).
There are paintings on the walls from local artists, people playing boardgames, and sometimes, live music.
Good selection of local and national brands.
a few of their beers require an additional $2)
You get a good server one day and a terrible one the next.
but this place was such a huge disappointment.
We visited here for dinner one evening while in town.
and it was a good roast, but not great, while my partner had a fish dish that I thought was superb and would go well with any of the weizen´s on tap.
There is a pretty nice sized cooler filled with a large variety.
The food is really great and reasonably priced, and also they have a great selection as well.
The spot is big and has plenty of history.
We ordered a cheese plate and it was awesome as well.
The hard part is navigating through this area where the wait staff retrive the food from the kitchen to get back to the bar.
There are so many great options for food and drink in New Orleans.
I like this place cause its small, laid back, and has good beer.
I visited this place a bit by accident, as I was looking for one of the Crown Liquors that's not too far away.
The food was above average, and even though it was chilly outside when we visited, the crowd was packed inside, and even sitting out on the deck area.
Does it really require an explanation ahead of time?
This is Stefan's (owner/brewer Musketeers) favorite pub.
Only drawback to me is the food selection.
Located just north of University in downtown Berkeley.
Why does the bent look not go all the way along?
A few tables in a little grassy area across the street were occupied by people drinking in "to-go" cups and there were metal Yards bottle openers on the wooden fence posts!
The crowd was very diverse with a mix of yuppies, hippies, middle agers and old folks too.
Stopped in for lunch in late afternoon on a Thursday, and there were only a couple other people there.
4 regular taps with 2 more for seasonal brews, and several guest taps as well.
They always have lots of good San Diego locals on tap, as well as a solid bottle list.
Got there before 7 and their happy hour has $2 off draft.
They do have a better selection than other "normal" bars that are popular, but still not too much out of the ordinary.
Very nice looking place, with a few flat screen, a couple delivering HDTV (the Sox were on against the Yanks).
The quality of all the beers was good, and I like that they use larger than normal glasses for the taster pours.
10 taps, plus a list of what's fermenting
Alverium is very comfortable with the foosball machine and table top shuffleboard.
They currently have about 525 bottles tucked away for sale and more cellered for future release.
The beer menu is not organized well and is a bit ackward to navigate.
but I got the running out of taster glasses too...
Beers are available in full pours or 5 oz tasters ($8 for a flight of any four) or to go.
Despite working just 3 blocks away, Ringlers has never been a regular haunt.
Crazy big selection from peanut butter and jelly to steaks.
Owner and staff are friendly and they are getting more into beer.
Asked for an Endo IPA and what I got was clearly a wheat beer...
Was bummed that we had no say in what we would have there.
Perfect location for an old beer soul to settle down in Sydney.
This is local for me, and is definitely a great pub with great service.
The low ABV side is pretty big and they feature things such as growler fills, seasonal displays and a decent selection of glassware.
Again, I wouldn't go here unless I needed something in particular (this time it was to get an Abacus).
about 10 bucks.also ordered a pizza witch wasnt the greatest
Brutopia has been around a long time and makes some decent beers
While it doesn't have the widest selection available
Great spot in quiet area in the back of a Paris neighborhood.
They do NOT gouge you when they get that small allotment of DFH or new releases.
It's just a good place to get some decent beer and hang out.
This place is located near Little Tokyo in the Arts District.
A glance over the bar showed an extensive variety of draft beers and when I took a look at the beer list the bottled selection was equally impressive.
I'm back in town for the summer and my buddy has been telling me to check out this store, knowing my interest in craft beer.
A brewpub in an airport in Utah with a nice view of the nearby mountain range?
samples were pricey but they didn't want you having something you didn't like.
I was there - neither of them seemed to be interested in beer.
Stopped off here on my way out of Madison for a couple of beers and a bite...
It mirrors the look of a typical British Pub.
I visited on a Friday after the Heady lines, but there was still lots of Sip of Sunshine, which was a nice thing.
The bartender was a bit distracted and kept forgetting my order.
The "chalkboard" is digital and is clearly displayed and can be seen from everywhere, which is nice, because you don't have to keep asking your server what's on tap.
the server seemed disinterested and sort of lazy, dispassionate, and maybe checked out, but i eventually got my beer and food, so i cant complain too much.
you walk into a vast shop area, cool right from the get go
A: This place is on the end of a little strip mall.
The beer selection was more limited than Bukowski's, but much more agreeably priced and just as well-considered.
8 regular taps [although out of one on my visit] plus 3 seasonals.
i guess they have a few spots around town now, but this is the original, where all or most anyway of the production is happening these days.
I've had BBQ wings (very good), pizza (very good too), and chicken sandwich (not too shabby).
If the weather is nice, there will be a line for beer at 5:00PM on weekdays.
You can almost always find one or two San Diego IPAs on tap (yesterday it was Ballast Point Sculpin, Coronado Islander, and Eagle Rock IPA).
Cool vibe and great people along with some pretty good beers.
Note that this place is really more of a café than a bar.
but I pictured how crowded the inside would get in winter.
It was a cool evening at the end of January.
The bartenders are all good looking, not conventionally so, and that makes it even more wonderful.
I picked up Founders Doom, some FFF stuff.
Cock & Bull Glendale Village has a quaint, neighborhood pub feel.
BUT I had heard good things about the coffee porter so wanted that.
Around a dozen taps on hand, and the only bogey I saw was a single Bud tap at one end.
The tour guides had amazing stories about the foundation of New Belgium and the names behind their beers.
la plupart disponibles à la S.A.Q. Peu de place au bières de petites microbrasseries, nouvelles ou peu connues.
I unfortunately did not have a lot of time, but I wanted to be able to stop in and at least see all these places as there seems to be a good amount of scene here in Decatur.
I'm not a big fan of sours, but if anyone is representing the style properly, this is the place; they have a big variety on tap all made right here.
The bottle list is about 80% or more the same as the Belgian bar I worked in Philly.
I still remember when the brewery was ran out of a garage.
The brewing equipment was visible at the rear.
Totally unprepared for the last minute trip, and not even having a Laptop, I was completely lost.
Anyways, they have plenty of great beer, some that were brewed on site.
so its kinda of a hole in the wall type of place younger crowd with loud music.
The beer list is good, with around 20 taps and a well chosen selection.
Very funky vibe , double sided (dinig/bar) with a nice patio .
The real reason I praise this store is for their whisky selection.
The brewery themselves had a decent swath of options, including lagers, some dark beers, a German and Belgian offering or two, and of course a few IPAs.
The beers were good and the food was good.
well worth a visit and quite easy to find off of the highway....
the nice part is I was able to find the beer and food pairing
Seemed like a natural given the interest in German food and culture by all of us,
But, they also allow other food in as long as it is bought through neighbor businesses in the Salt complex.
They had about 46 on tap and 150 in bottles.
There is a front porch area with picnic or bar-hall type tables.
Selection certainly offerered numerous quality options.
Recently I have only been here for events which the brewery allows different groups to use the tap room.
Of course, one finds the usual array of plasma TVs and booths all about.
The Chandos is right off of Trafalgar Square.
Beers are mostly served in proper branded glassware, which is impressive considering the selection.
There was a discussion of vintage cigarette cases among we bar patrons.
The quality of the beer selection in this store is exceptional.
You can get some craft brews here, but not much of a selection.
It's a really relaxing atmosphere, good for kids, and usually not too crowded.
and i know if Flagship went down that road they'd be great, too.
That being said, their quality and prices are fantastic.
There seems to be adequate parking although the lot is shared with other businesses.
Let me write that again, Réservoir is the best brew
Food creative and delicious, not too expensive.
They also had Trappist beers for $3.99 a bottle, which is cheaper than I usually find them for.
love this brewery, just wish I liked their actual beer a little more.
It's split into two small rooms, one barely more than a hall with a bar and a few tables, and the other slightly larger with more seating.
Free wings on football Sundays can make this a bit of a madhouse.
for my area its the best beer bar around.
The beer menu is a mile long and almost none of it is your run-of-the-mill bar selections.
I'll get my complaint out of the way at the start.
Amen, for this underground gem of a beer bar.
---This place is now closed and has become the Old Bag of Nails---
Very easy to find and friendly staff too...
Doesn't look like much, until you see the beer list.
Nice selection of 3 Floyds, Founders etc.
For those seeking it, this shop does carry Westvleteren 6, 8, and 12 and a couple general
Its clean and metallic inside with wood table tops.
Pleasant laid back environment and very knowlegable helpful service.
2nd stop of our Kolsch tour on 10/07/2010
We grabbed a couple of seats at the relatively small bar and ordered some wings and beers.
Most of their stuff is on the hoppy side though so be prepared.
There was definitely a line as we were leaving - being on the early side helped.
Only a few tables to stand at on the outside, but a small beer garden at rear in a shared courtyard.
Even though other places have passed them in adventurous taps, I'll still stop in.
though since my first review of this place, smoking has been limited to the upstairs area (nice).
The place is very well lit with a clean/industrial like environment.
I hope these are growing pains (the place is very new still) which will be resolved with time.
I got a two flights consisting of various styles such as pales, ipas, stouts, scotch ale, even a bourbon barrel old ale.
CV has a decent atmosphere, but this is interesting to me - back in 99, my fraternity almost purchased the building and it was quite the place at the time.
On my most recent visit to Baltimore, I finally convinced some friends to check out Brewer's Art after we finished working at around 9pm.
We discovered a cute little back bar hidden around the corner from the main area and settled in.
The Long Room is a neighborhood (almost) dive bar with amazing beer.
great bottle selection as you can see below.
The brewery is hidden all the way in the back in the corner.
Besides quality beers and service the food is pretty good as well
I visit Pivovarsky Klub because of the various range of tap and bottled beers.
That being said the restaurant is very nice, albeit very loud.
Sadly the Franconian biers are falling to the wayside
They have a good selection of drafts and more bottles.
I thought this place was pretty cool, basically it's been built within an old airplane hangar that overlooks the San Francisco bay.
Had the Brunch breakfast Stout and a Burner IPA-both good enough but nothing to rave about.
and they always seem to have an awesome tap list no matter what.
Also some stand alone displays around the cooler.
This just might be the best place for beer in Charleston and just screams quality from every inch of it.
A small bar is located along one side and there are about half a dozen tables in the back.
The aisles are small and the dog could not help but to walk on my shoes.
Looking around the bar from our seats, I noticed a whisky selection that got me to drool a bit.
I'd seen it on here but saw that it had changed owners and people seemed to think the quality of the place had gone down.
so you can work and have a few pints aswell.
they didn't have was we Americans (one from Buffalo)
The selection is very good in bottles and decent on draft.
Been here a couple times now, and headed back in 10 days.
The bar manager Rich is an encyclopedia of beer knowledge and is one of the friendliest people in the Philly food service industry.
In a plaza/strip mall location=rather boring inside and outside.
Finally got a chance to stop in here the other day.
The service at the bar was good even though they were busy at the time.
inside, lots of polished marble and wood, tiny marble pillars forming little private-feeling areas, carvings, mirrors, and clever phrases along the ceiling.
This has a much more neighborhood feel to it.
There were definitely some interesting gems (i.e. large format Black Damnation beers); however, nothing really rung my bell.
The tap room is just a section of their brewery, so
The beer list is decent featuring Guinness, Kilkenny, and Harp among others.
In an area apparently lacking in craft beer locations, this is a beacon of beer.
It has yet to let me down in anyway, and let me just say that without the advice and support from Tom, I wouldn't have had such a wonderful, running start.
So in closing my recommendation is FUCK THIS PLACE, THIER PISS POOR ATTITUDE, LACK LUSTER CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND NON EXISTANT BEER KNOWLEDGE.
Don't get me wrong, their selection is fabulous and I love that it is all in coolers.
I've always found the staff to be very friendly and helpful as well.
and he told they were reintroducing the brand to NYC after a two-year pullout with a bunch of kegs at two bars.
The framboise was out of the this world and the strong bitter had just enough pop with a nice malt balance
but I believe the last time I was in there
part of an earlier wave of breweries, they have matured really nicely.
Space is small, so feels crowded pretty easily.
Cooter's is a great place for someone who is willing to try a lot of beers from all over the world.
Regardless of the city, this is a top-notch beer bar and worth a stop for any BA visiting the area.
Would highly recommend this as a lunch and beer hangout spot.
I live at University of Nebraska at Omaha and east of this university is the Dundee area.
They are geared more to selling the common craft beers rather than more unique beers.
Even rarer to find that the smoking "aroma" is so well contained it does not bother a former smoker.
oz. bottles you can mix & match allowing customers to try a variety of beers without purchasing
My guess is that the crowd was in its 20's to mid 30's.
For my personal tastes, I liked that they had a couple bigger beers and especially some hoppy, less available beers like Avery Maharaja.
Amazing prices and an awesome bottle selection for on-site consumption or to-go
The outside has a back bar with 30+ taps...
Upstairs has an old pub feel overlooking the rest of the place.
It is a small bottle shop in the NoDa neighborhood of Charlotte.
Old fashioned brewpub just off the green in downtown Burlington.
