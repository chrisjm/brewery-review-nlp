    "\n",
    "How can we generate short descriptions including a list of popular beer styles from brewery reviews with natural language processing (NLP)? \n",

    "\n",
    "* Clean the dataset and address issues like missing values and duplicate values. \n",

Especially when it came to price, in Holland & Belgium their beers are very cheap compared to what we see in the US. Here the US beer prices were comparable to Belgian prices in the US.  2011-02-13 21770\n",
      "45415 4.58 This is a must stop for anyone visiting Amsterdam or locals who haven't been exposed to American craft beer. BeerTemple is small in size, but absolutely huge in terms of selecion. In fact, they have a better American craft selection than anywhere here in Nashville. 2011-02-28 21770\n",
      "45414 4.14 Beer temple was my final stop during my St Patrick's day Amsterdam beer bar crawl. It is best described as an American beer bar smack in the middle of Amsterdam. Founders, Jolly Pumpkin, Great Divide, Anchor, Left Hand, Flying Dog; basically all of the usual suspects for a solid American craft beer bar. They also have a very good selection of European/Belgian beers, as would be expected, but the emphasis is clearly to be an American beer bar first. 2011-03-22 21770\n",
      "45413 4.15 I looked up a number of places before visiting Amsterdam because I wanted to find the best beer bars in town. This place wasn't on any list and we literally passed it on our way to somewhere else and stopped in. It has an unbelievable beer list but it is primarily american beers. Although it was quite impressive I go to american craft beer bars all the time. I 2011-05-03 21770\n",
      "45412 4.29 A great find in Amsterdam! Centrally located in the city centre, just a few minutes walk from just about everything, this place not only has a terrific selection of craft American beers on tap and in bottles, it has a great staff!  2011-06-26 21770\n",
      "45411 4.0 the first american beer bar in europe,at least that is what they say in the bar. The ambiance is nice, bit 70s decoration. Not crowded when i was there (sunday afternoon). Service was very friendly, although had the feeling i knew more what he was selling than he did. List of beers is decent, as expected mainly american ipa and ris beers. Also small selection of european beers like mikkeller and brewdog. Bottle prices are too high (more than 20 euro for lost abbey angeld share 37cl), price of draft beers is ok, 4 euro for 25 cl. Nice place 2011-07-03 21770\n",

      "45409 3.88 I visited this Amsterdam bar on Sunday night (October 23rd 2011) after having a meal in a nearby restaurant. It had been on my list of places to hit on my Amsterdam weekend and was dismayed to find out that it was closing at 10pm and we would only have time for one beer! So I went for a brew from Great Divide; the fantastic oak aged Imperial stout on tap.  2011-10-25 21770\n",
      "45408 4.24 My second stop in Amsterdam, a night after Arendsnest. This is a solid American bar with a good atmosphere, knowledgeable bartenders, and good (albeit expensive) selection. A little under 20 American brews on tap, mostly IPAs and stouts, along with a few European brews, including Mikkeller and Brew Dog.  2012-05-16 21770\n"
