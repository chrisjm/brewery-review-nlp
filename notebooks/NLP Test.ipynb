    "# Brewery Review NLP Workbook\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to discover and demonstrate the NLP pipeline we will use to process brewery reviews into short phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples from Google Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mike Hess Brewing, North Park - Modern, family-friendly hangout featuring a tasting room, board games & brewery views.\n",
    "* North Park Beer Company - Spacious brewery & taproom serving San Diego-style ales & lagers amid dapper decor.\n",
    "* Rip Current Brewing North Park - This chill, wood-paneled joint with a roomy bar offers pub grub & house-brewed craft beers on tap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentiment - Only analyze positive sentiment reviews for the descriptions. Though it might be interesting to experiement with including both positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "* Opinions - Some reviews include only opinions about a place and may not be accurate or useful. \n",
    "* Named Entity Recognition - This will be interesting to process to see if the models are able to match the right entities.\n",
    "* Context-free Grammar - The Google Maps are somewhat predictable in their structure so I wonder if they generate those senteces with a pre-defined grammar. \n",
    "* Beer Styles - Beer Advocate has current beers and style so it will be straight-forward to scrape the most popular styles to include with the descriptions. \n",
    "* Natural Language Generation (NLG) - How to generate the sentences or phrases so that they make sense?\n",
    "* Markov Chains - Simple solution might be to use [`markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) to do the simple generation. It will be very dependant on the reviewer's writing style, but combining all into one might regularize."

Zigzag bar seats probably 40 to 50, and there are a number of tables spread about the room. Additionally, there is a patio in front with nightly food truck. 25 beers on tap, half were brewery only seasonals and specials. Place had an after-work unwind sort of vibe.

They had ample seating inside and out. The beer selection tonight was nice. They had a couple Speedway variants I tried - Jamaican Blue Mountain and Thai. Both were solid beers. Had a couple of tasters and made my way back to my hotel I'm staying for a conference. Overall, a splendid place to visit and hang out with friends.</br></div></span>"
